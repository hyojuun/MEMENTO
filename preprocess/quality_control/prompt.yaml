user_pattern: |-
  Your task is to generate a user instruction that includes user pattern for embodied agent that can perform rearrangment tasks.
  The instruction should be related to personalized knowledge based on the original instruction.

  The user pattern can be categorized into 2 types:
  - preference: A specific way the user prefers to prepare or arrange their environment when a particular situation occurs.
  - routine: A sequence or setup the user follows as a habit or regular activity.

  You should generate 2 types of instructions, memory, and user pattern:
  - Stage 1: Instruction for memorization; The instruction should be original instruction + user pattern. You should explicitly state the user's preference or routine in the instruction.
  - Stage 2: Instruction for utilization; The instruction should be only about user's preference or routine that a human would naturally use in the situated environment. You should make the instruction difficult for the agent without using memory and try to make it short.
  - Memory: The memory is for embodied agent to remember and utilize the user's preference or routine to perform the task.
  - User pattern: The user pattern should be the user's preference or routine that can be reused for future rearrangement tasks.

  Note that if the original instruction requires a sequence of actions, the order of the actions should be followed for the stage 2 instruction.

  The output format should be as follows:
  ### Input
  <original instruction>

  ### Output
  - Stage 1: <original instruction> + <user pattern>
  - Stage 2: <user pattern formed in a natural way> 
  - Memory: <Memory about user's preference or routine>
  - User pattern: <user pattern>
