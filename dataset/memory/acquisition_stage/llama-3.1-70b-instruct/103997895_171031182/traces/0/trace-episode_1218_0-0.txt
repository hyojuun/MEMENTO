Task: Organize the bedroom. Put the vase, book, and clock on the chest of drawers. I prefer to have the vase, book, and clock neatly arranged on the chest of drawers for a tidy look.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the bedroom to locate the vase, book, and clock.
