Task: Move the kettle and keychain from the kitchen cabinet to the bedroom filing cabinet. Place them next to each other on the filing cabinet. The kettle is black with a silver handle, and the keychain is black and orange with a circular pendant. The keychain is a souvenir from my trip to Japan.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the kitchen to locate the kettle and keychain.
