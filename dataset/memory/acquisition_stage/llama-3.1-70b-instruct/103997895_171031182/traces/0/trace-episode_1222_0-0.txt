Task: Move the kettle and keychain from the kitchen cabinet to the bedroom filing cabinet. Place them next to each other on the filing cabinet. I like to keep my kettle and keychain together in the bedroom for convenience in the morning.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the kitchen to locate the kettle and keychain, as they are likely to be in the kitchen cabinet.

Thought: The filing cabinet does not have a receptacle for the kettle to be placed "on" it. Since the task requires placing the kettle and keychain next to each other on the filing cabinet, I will try to place the kettle "within" the filing cabinet instead.
