Task: Move the android figure to a new living room table. Also, move the action figure to a new living room table. The android figure is a black and white Android_Figure_Panda, and the action figure is a green and blue Leonardo from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. The Android figure is a collectible item.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring a room where the android figure and action figure might be located. I will begin with the living room, as it is a common place for collectible items to be displayed.

Thought: I have found multiple android figures and action figures in the living room. I need to identify the black and white Android_Figure_Panda and the green and blue Leonardo from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. I will use the DescribeObjectTool to determine which objects match these descriptions.
