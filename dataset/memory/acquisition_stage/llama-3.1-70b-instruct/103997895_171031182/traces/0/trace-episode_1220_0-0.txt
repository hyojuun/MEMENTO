Task: Move the jug, cup, and plate to the living room table. I always like to have the jug, cup, and plate ready on the living room table for my afternoon tea time.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore a room that might contain the jug, cup, and plate. The kitchen is a common place for these objects, so I will explore it first.
