Task: Put the candle holder, statue, and vase back on the table in the bedroom. The candle holder is white and tan with a rounded base, the statue is beige on a black base, and the vase is white with a rounded body and narrow neck. The vase was a gift from my best friend.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the bedroom_1 to locate the white and tan candle holder with a rounded base, the beige statue on a black base, and the white vase with a rounded body and narrow neck.

Thought: I have found multiple objects in the kitchen_1, including vases, statues, and a candle holder. However, I need to determine which ones match the descriptions of the objects I need to put back on the table in the bedroom. I will use the DescribeObjectTool to get more information about each object.

I have now identified two of the objects I need to move: statue_1 and vase_2. However, I still need to find the correct candle holder. Since I have already described the objects found in the kitchen and none of them match the description of the candle holder, I should explore other rooms to find it.
