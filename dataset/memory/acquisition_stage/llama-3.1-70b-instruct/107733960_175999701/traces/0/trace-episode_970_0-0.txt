Task: Move the laptop and phone stand to the table in the office. Place them next to each other on the table. I prefer to have my laptop and phone stand together on the office table for my work setup.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring a room that might contain a laptop and phone stand. The office (office_1) is a common place for these objects, so I will explore it first.
