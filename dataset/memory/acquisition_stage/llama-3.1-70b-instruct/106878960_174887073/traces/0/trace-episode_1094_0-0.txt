Task: First, move the plate from the dining table to the chair. Then, place it on the table in the office. I typically move my plate to the office table to have my lunch while working.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the dining room to locate the plate, as it is mentioned to be on the dining table.
