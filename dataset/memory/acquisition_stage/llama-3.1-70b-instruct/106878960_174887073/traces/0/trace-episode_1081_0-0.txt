Task: Take the basket, can, and plant container from the kitchen cabinet to the dining table. I typically set them on the dining table for easy access when I'm organizing a centerpiece.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the kitchen to locate the basket, can, and plant container in the kitchen cabinet.
