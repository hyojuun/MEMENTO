Task: Move the toy airplane and then the toy vehicle from the bedroom shelves to the living room couch and place them next to each other. I like to have the toys on the living room couch for easy access when playing with the kids in the afternoon.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring a room to locate the toy airplane and the toy vehicle. I will begin with bedroom_1, as it is a common place for toys to be found.
