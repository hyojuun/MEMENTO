Task: First, move the clock and then the picture frame from the living room shelves to the bedroom table. Then place them next to each other on the table. The clock is round and white with black numbers and a brown frame. The picture frame is ornate with a gold and blue design. The clock was a gift from my grandmother.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the living room to locate the clock and picture frame on the shelves.

Thought: I have found multiple clocks and picture frames on shelves_41 in the living room. I need to identify which clock is the round and white with black numbers and a brown frame, and which picture frame is ornate with a gold and blue design. I will use the DescribeObjectTool to get more information about these objects.

Thought: The description of clock_6 does not match the round and white with black numbers and a brown frame clock. I will now describe clock_0 to see if it matches the description of the clock.

Thought: The description of clock_0 matches the round and white with black numbers and a brown frame clock. Now, I need to identify which picture frame is ornate with a gold and blue design. I will describe picture_frame_1 to see if it matches the description of the picture frame.
