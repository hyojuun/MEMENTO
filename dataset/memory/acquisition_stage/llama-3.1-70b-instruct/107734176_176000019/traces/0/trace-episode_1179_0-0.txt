Task: Move the plant saucer and plant container from the table in the living room to the bench in the bathroom. Place them next to each other. The plant container is green, named Central Garden Flower Pot Goo 425, and the plant saucer is a green, square Ecoforms Quadra Saucer SQ1 Avocado. Both are part of my indoor gardening set.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the living room to locate the plant saucer and plant container on the table.

Thought: I have found multiple plant saucers and plant containers on table_15 in the living room. I need to identify which ones match the description of the green, square Ecoforms Quadra Saucer SQ1 Avocado and the green Central Garden Flower Pot Goo 425. I will use the DescribeObjectTool to get more information about each plant saucer and plant container.
