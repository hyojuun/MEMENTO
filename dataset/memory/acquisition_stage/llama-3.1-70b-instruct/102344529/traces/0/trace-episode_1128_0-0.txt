Task: Move the tray to the cabinet in the toilet room and put the can on the counter in the lounge. The tray is white with cutout handles, and the can is a silver can of Polar Herring Fillets, Smoked & Peppered, 7.05 oz. The tray is a gift from my grandmother.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring a room where the tray and can might be located. A common place for trays and cans is the kitchen or a similar area. I will explore the kitchen to see if the tray and can are there.
