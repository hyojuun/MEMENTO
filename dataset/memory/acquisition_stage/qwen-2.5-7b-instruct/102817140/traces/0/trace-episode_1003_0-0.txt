Task: Move the book and pencil case from the living room table to the chest of drawers in the bedroom. Place them next to each other. I like to keep my book and pencil case together on the chest of drawers in the bedroom for late-night study sessions.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the living room to locate the book and pencil case on the table.
