Task: Place the laptop stand on the living room table next to the laptop. I prefer to keep my laptop stand next to the laptop on the living room table for easy access during work sessions.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the living room to locate the laptop stand and the table next to the laptop.
