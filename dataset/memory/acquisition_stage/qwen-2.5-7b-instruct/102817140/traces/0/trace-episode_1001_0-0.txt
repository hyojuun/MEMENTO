Task: Move the laptop and then the laptop stand from the living room table to the bedroom table and place them next to each other. I prefer to have my laptop and stand set up in the bedroom for a more comfortable work environment.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the living room to locate the laptop and laptop stand.
