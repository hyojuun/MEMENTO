Task: Move the jug and cup from the kitchen counter to the living room table. Place them next to each other. I prefer to have the jug and cup together in the living room for afternoon refreshments.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the kitchen to locate the jug and cup on the counter.
