Task: Put the phone stand, laptop stand, and multiport hub on the table in the bedroom. I prefer to have my phone stand, laptop stand, and multiport hub in the bedroom for a tidy and organized workspace.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore a room I have not explored yet. The bedroom is a logical place to start as it is mentioned in the task that I need to put the phone stand, laptop stand, and multiport hub there.
