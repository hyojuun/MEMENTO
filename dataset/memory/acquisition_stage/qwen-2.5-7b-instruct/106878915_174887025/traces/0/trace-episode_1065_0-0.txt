Task: Help me organize my closet in the bedroom. First, place the basket and shoe on another shelf in the bedroom, next to each other. Then, move them to the stand in the bedroom and place the hat close by. I have a routine of organizing my closet by first rearranging items on the shelf before placing them on the stand with the hat nearby.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the bedroom_1 to locate the basket, shoe, and hat.
