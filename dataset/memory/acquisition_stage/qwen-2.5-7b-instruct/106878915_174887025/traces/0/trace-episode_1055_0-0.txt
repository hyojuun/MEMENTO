Task: Move the toy airplane to the living room couch. Take the book and laptop to the living room table. I usually keep the toy airplane on the couch for playtime, and I prefer having the book and laptop on the living room table for study sessions.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore a room I have not explored yet. The living room (living_room_1) seems like a good place to start as it contains the couch and table where the toy airplane and objects need to be moved.
