Task: Put away the one jug and one cup in the kitchen cabinet. I prefer to keep the jug and cup in the kitchen cabinet for easy access during breakfast.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the kitchen_1 to locate the jug and cup.

Thought: The objects have been found in the kitchen_1. I have located a jug (jug_0) and a cup (cup_1) on the counter_34. The next step is to pick up the jug and take it to the kitchen cabinet (cabinet_35 or cabinet_41).
