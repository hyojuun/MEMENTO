Task: Put the shoe and pencil case on the bedroom chest of drawers. I prefer to keep my shoe and pencil case on the chest of drawers for quick access when I'm getting ready in the morning.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore a room I have not explored yet. The bedroom_1 seems like a good place to start as it contains a chest of drawers.

Thought: The exploration of bedroom_1 did not find the shoe or pencil case. Let's try another room that might contain these items, such as the living room_1.
