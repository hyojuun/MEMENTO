Task: Move the stuffed toy from the couch to the chair in the living room. Place it next to the table. I like to keep the stuffed toy next to the table on the chair for decoration and easy access during my reading time.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the living room to locate the stuffed toy on the couch.
