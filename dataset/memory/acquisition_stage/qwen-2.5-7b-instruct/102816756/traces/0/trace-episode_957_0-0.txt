Task: Bring the book from the living room to the bedroom and place it on the chest of drawers. The book is white with subtle yellow accents and a bookmark. This book was a gift from my friend.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the living room to locate the white book with subtle yellow accents and a bookmark.

Thought: The exploration of the living room was successful, and I found two books on table_48. I need to determine which one is the white book with subtle yellow accents and a bookmark.
