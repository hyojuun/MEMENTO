Task: Move the jug and cup from the kitchen counter to the dining table. Place them next to each other on the table. The jug is cream-colored with a curved handle, and the cup is black with a smooth surface. The cup is part of my favorite dinnerware.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the kitchen to locate the cream-colored jug and the black cup.
