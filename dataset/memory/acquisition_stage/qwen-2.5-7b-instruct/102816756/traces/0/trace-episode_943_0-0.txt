Task: Put the plate and bowl together in another cabinet in the kitchen and place them next to each other. I prefer to keep my plates and bowls next to each other in the cabinet for easy access when setting the table.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the kitchen_1 to locate the plate and bowl.
