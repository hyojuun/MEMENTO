Task: Place the vase on the shelves, the candle on the table? The vase is white with a faceted design, and the candle is mint green with white butterfly designs. The vase is a family heirloom.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore a room I have not explored yet to locate the white vase with a faceted design and the mint green candle with white butterfly designs.
