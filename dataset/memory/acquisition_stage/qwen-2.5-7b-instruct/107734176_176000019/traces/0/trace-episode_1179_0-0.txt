Task: Move the plant saucer and plant container from the table in the living room to the bench in the bathroom. Place them next to each other. The plant container is green, named Central Garden Flower Pot Goo 425, and the plant saucer is a green, square Ecoforms Quadra Saucer SQ1 Avocado. Both are part of my indoor gardening set.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the living room to locate the green plant container and the green, square plant saucer.

Thought: The previous attempt to place the plant saucer next to the plant container failed because the plant container is already on the bench, and the bench is not a receptacle for placing another object next to it. Instead, I should place the plant saucer on the bench next to the plant container.
