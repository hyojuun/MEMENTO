Task: First, move the phone stand and candle to the bedroom couch? Then, relocate them to the dining table and place them next to each other. Leave the doll on the living room couch. I like to move the phone stand and candle to the bedroom couch occasionally before finally placing them on the dining table next to each other for dining ambiance. The doll stays on the living room couch as part of the decor.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore a room I have not explored yet to locate the phone stand and candle.

Result: Unexpected failure! - No valid placements found for entity table_36. It looks like the spatial constraint next_to is not feasible because the reference object phone_stand_0 either does not exist or has not yet been placed on the table_36. Try placing the grasped object candle_1 on table_36 without the spatial constraint next_to.
