Task: Take the basket, can, and plant container from the kitchen cabinet to the dining table? The basket is a teal plastic Spritz Easter Basket, the can is a brown and yellow coffee can, Don Francisco's Gourmet Coffee Medium Decaf, and the plant container is a white and green Cole Hardware Orchid Pot 85. The coffee can is my favorite brand.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the kitchen to locate the teal plastic Spritz Easter Basket, the brown and yellow coffee can, and the white and green Cole Hardware Orchid Pot 85.
