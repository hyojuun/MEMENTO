Task: Move the laptop and mouse pad from the office table to the bedroom chest of drawers. Place them next to each other on the chest of drawers. The laptop is black with a backlit keyboard, and the mouse pad is black with a logo in the corner. The laptop is my personal work device.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the office_1 to locate the black laptop with a backlit keyboard and the black mouse pad with a logo in the corner.

Thought: The previous attempt to place the mouse pad next to the laptop on the chest_of_drawers_50 failed because the `Place` action does not support placing objects next to each other on the same furniture. Instead, I will place the mouse pad on the chest_of_drawers_50 and then use the `FindObjectTool` to find the laptop to ensure they are next to each other.
