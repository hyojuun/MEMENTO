Task: Move the laptop stand and multiport hub from the office table to the bedroom table. Place them next to each other on the table. I prefer to have my laptop stand and multiport hub together in the bedroom for my late-night work sessions.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the office to locate the laptop stand and multiport hub on the table.

Thought: The previous attempt to place the multiport hub next to the laptop stand failed because "next_to" is not a valid spatial relation for placing objects on a table. Instead, I should place the multiport hub on the table next to the laptop stand.

Thought: The previous attempt to place the multiport hub on the table failed because I was not close enough to the table or the table is occluded. I need to navigate closer to table_60 in the bedroom to ensure I am in the correct position to place the multiport hub.

Result: Incorrect syntax for place/rearrange skill. reference_object was valid, but corresponding spatial_constraint was none. This may not be the correct node name, try using appropriate tool to get the exact name. If that doesnt work, this node may just not exist yet, explore the house to discover.
