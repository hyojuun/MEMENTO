Task: Help me tidy up the hallway shelves. First, move the book, vase, and stuffed toy to the living room table. Place them next to each other. When tidying, I prefer to have the book, vase, and stuffed toy together on the living room table for a cohesive look.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the hallway_1 to locate the book, vase, and stuffed toy on the shelves.
