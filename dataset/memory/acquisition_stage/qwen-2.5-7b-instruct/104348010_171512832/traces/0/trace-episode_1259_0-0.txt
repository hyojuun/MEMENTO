Task: Move the apple, the tomato, and the bread from the kitchen counter to the dining table. Place them next to each other on the table. I usually have these items arranged on the dining table for my breakfast.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the kitchen_1 to locate the apple, the tomato, and the bread on the counter.
