Task: Help me tidy up the hallway shelves. First, move the book, vase, and stuffed toy to the living room table. Place them next to each other. The book has a colorful cover with architectural imagery, the vase is white with brown accents and a glossy finish, and the stuffed toy is a gray elephant with a soft, plush texture called Sootheze Cold Therapy Elephant. The vase is a gift from my friend.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the hallway to locate the book, vase, and stuffed toy on the shelves.

Thought: The hallway did not contain the objects I was looking for. I should explore the next room, which is the living room, to see if the objects are there.
