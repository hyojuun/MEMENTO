Task: Move the plate and bowl from the dining table to the kitchen counter. Place them next to each other on the counter. I always keep the plate and bowl together on the kitchen counter after meals for easy cleanup.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the dining room to locate the plate and bowl on the dining table.
