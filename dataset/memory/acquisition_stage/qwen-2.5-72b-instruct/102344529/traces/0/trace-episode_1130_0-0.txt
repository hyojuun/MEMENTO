Task: Move the picture frame and vase from the dining room table to the TV shelves. Place them next to each other on the shelves. The picture frame is wooden with a black and white dove image, and the vase is brown and beige with a pebble-like pattern. The picture frame holds a special photo of my family's pet dove.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the dining room to locate the wooden picture frame with a black and white dove image and the brown and beige vase with a pebble-like pattern.
