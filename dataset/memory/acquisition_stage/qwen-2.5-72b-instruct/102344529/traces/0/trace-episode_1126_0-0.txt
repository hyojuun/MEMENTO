Task: Move a laptop and a laptop stand from the lounge counter to the dining room table. Place them next to each other on the table. The laptop is black with a dark keyboard, and the laptop stand is black with a rounded design. These items are part of my work setup.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the lounge to locate the laptop and laptop stand on the counter.
