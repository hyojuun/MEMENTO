Task: Move the phone stand to the tv table. Move the statue to the lounge counter. The phone stand is black with a minimalist design, and the statue is green of a sitting dog. The statue was a gift from my best friend.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring a room to locate the phone stand and the statue. I will begin with the tv_1 room, as it is a common place for a phone stand, and the lounge_1 room for the statue, as it is a common place for decorative items.
