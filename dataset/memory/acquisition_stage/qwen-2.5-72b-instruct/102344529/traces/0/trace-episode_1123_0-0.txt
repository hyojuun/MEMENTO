Task: Move the phone stand to a new dining room chair. Also, move the statue to a new dining room chair. The phone stand is silver and light blue with a sleek design, and the statue is dark bronze with elongated features. The statue was a gift from my best friend.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring a room to locate the phone stand and the statue. I will begin with the tv room, as it is a common place for decorative items like a phone stand and a statue.
