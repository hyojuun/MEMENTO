Task: Move the tray to the cabinet in the toilet room and put the can on the counter in the lounge. The tray is white with cutout handles, and the can is a silver can of Polar Herring Fillets, Smoked & Peppered, 7.05 oz. The tray is a gift from my grandmother.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the lounge_1 to locate the silver can of Polar Herring Fillets, Smoked & Peppered, 7.05 oz. If the can is not found, I will then explore the toilet_1 to find the white tray with cutout handles.
