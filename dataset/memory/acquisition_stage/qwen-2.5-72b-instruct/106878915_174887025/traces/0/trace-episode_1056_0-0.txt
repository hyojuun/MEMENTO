Task: Put the phone stand, laptop stand, and multiport hub on the table in the bedroom. I prefer to have my phone stand, laptop stand, and multiport hub in the bedroom for a tidy and organized workspace.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore a room that might contain the phone stand, laptop stand, and multiport hub. The living room (living_room_1) is a common place for these items, so I will start there.

Thought: The living room did not contain the phone stand, laptop stand, or multiport hub. I will explore the kitchen (kitchen_1) next, as it is another common place where these items might be found.

Result: Node with name office_1 not present in the graph. This may not be the correct node name, try using appropriate tool to get the exact name. If that doesnt work, this node may just not exist yet, explore the house to discover.
