Task: Help me organize my closet in the bedroom. First, place the basket and shoe on another shelf in the bedroom, next to each other. Then, move them to the stand in the bedroom and place the hat close by. I have a routine of organizing my closet by first rearranging items on the shelf before placing them on the stand with the hat nearby.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the bedroom_1 to locate the basket and shoe, as they are likely to be in the closet or on the shelves in the bedroom.

However, the query specifies "another shelf in bedroom_1," and the information provided does not specify which bedroom the shelves are in. Based on the available data, there are two shelves in the bedroom, but we cannot determine if they are in bedroom_1 or another bedroom. 

If you need to find another shelf specifically in bedroom_1, you may need to provide more detailed information about the location of each shelf.

Thought: The query returned shelves_12 and shelves_14, but since I am already in bedroom_1 and shelves_14 is the one where the basket and shoe are currently located, I will use shelves_12 as the "another shelf" in bedroom_1. I will navigate to shelves_12 and place the basket there.
