Task: Move the vase and picture frame from the living room table to the lounge chair. Place them next to each other on the chair. I like to keep the vase and picture frame on the lounge chair as it creates a cozy decoration spot.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the living room to locate the vase and picture frame on the table.
