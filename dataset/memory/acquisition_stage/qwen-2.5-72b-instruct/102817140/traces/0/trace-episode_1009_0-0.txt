Task: Move the lamp to the bedroom table. Move the statue to the living room shelves. The lamp is wooden with a white spherical shade, and the statue is black hand-shaped with a glossy finish. The lamp was a gift from my grandmother.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the living room to locate the wooden lamp with a white spherical shade and the black hand-shaped statue with a glossy finish.
