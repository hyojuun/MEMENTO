Task: Move the phone stand, laptop stand, and multiport hub to the entryway and place them on the table. I prefer to have these items ready on the entryway table for when I head out for work.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring a room that might contain the phone stand, laptop stand, and multiport hub. The living room (living_room_1) is a common place for these items, so I will explore it first.
