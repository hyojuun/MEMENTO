Task: First, move the candle and then the vase from the living room shelves to the bathroom toilet. Place them next to each other on the toilet. The candle is tall and cylindrical with a lavender color, and the vase is dark blue with a faceted design. The candle is my favorite for relaxation.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the living room to locate the lavender cylindrical candle and the dark blue faceted vase.
