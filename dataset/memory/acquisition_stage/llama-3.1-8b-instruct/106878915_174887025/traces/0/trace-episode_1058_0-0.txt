Task: Move the candle and book from the bedroom shelves to the living room table. Place them next to each other on the table. I like to have the candle and book together on the living room table for a relaxing reading session.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring a room that might contain a candle and a book. The bedroom (bedroom_1) is a common place for books and candles, so I will explore it first.
