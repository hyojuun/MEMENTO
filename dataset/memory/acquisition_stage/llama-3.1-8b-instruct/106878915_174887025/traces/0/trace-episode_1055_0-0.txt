Task: Move the toy airplane to the living room couch. Take the book and laptop to the living room table. I usually keep the toy airplane on the couch for playtime, and I prefer having the book and laptop on the living room table for study sessions.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring a room that might contain one of the objects I need to move. The task mentions moving a toy airplane to the living room couch, and a book and a laptop to the living room table. I will choose a common room that often has objects of daily use, such as toys and books, which is the living_room_1.

Thought: I have found the toy airplane in the kitchen_1 on table_16. However, the task requires moving the toy airplane to the living room couch, and the book and laptop to the living room table.
