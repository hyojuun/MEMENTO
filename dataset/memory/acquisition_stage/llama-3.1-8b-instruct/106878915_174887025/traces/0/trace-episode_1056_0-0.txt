Task: Put the phone stand, laptop stand, and multiport hub on the table in the bedroom. I prefer to have my phone stand, laptop stand, and multiport hub in the bedroom for a tidy and organized workspace.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring a room that might contain the phone stand, laptop stand, and multiport hub. The living room (living_room_1) is a common place where these objects might be found, so I will explore it first.

Thought: Since I did not find the phone stand, laptop stand, or multiport hub in the living room, I should explore another room that might contain these objects. The kitchen (kitchen_1) is a common place where these objects might be found, so I will explore it next.
