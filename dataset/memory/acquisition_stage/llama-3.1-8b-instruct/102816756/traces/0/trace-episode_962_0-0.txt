Task: Help me prepare for lunch by moving the jug and cup from the kitchen counter to the dining table. Place them next to each other. The jug is light green with a curved spout, and the cup is light pink with Pantone 337 C marking. The cup is a gift from my best friend.
Thought: To find the jug and cup, I need to explore the kitchen where they are likely located.

Thought: I have found multiple objects on the counter in the kitchen. I need to identify which one is the light green jug with a curved spout and which one is the light pink cup with Pantone 337 C marking.
