Task: Change the positions of the vase, candle, and bowl to a different table in the living room. The vase is teal with a tall, slender neck, the candle is a gradient teal with a white top, and the bowl is brown wooden with a smooth finish. The candle was a gift from my friend.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the living room to locate the vase, candle, and bowl.
