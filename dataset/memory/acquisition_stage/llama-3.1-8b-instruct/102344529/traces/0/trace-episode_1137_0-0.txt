Task: First, move the candle from the table to the chair in the tv room. Then, place it on the tv table. The candle is mint green with white butterfly designs. This candle is my favorite.
Thought: Since the task requires moving the candle from the table to the chair in the tv room and then placing it on the tv table, I should first explore the tv room to locate the candle and the chair.
