Task: Move the phone stand to the tv table. Move the statue to the lounge counter. The phone stand is black with a minimalist design, and the statue is green of a sitting dog. The statue was a gift from my best friend.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring a room where the phone stand and the statue might be located. A common place for decorative items like these is the living room or a similar area. However, since the task doesn't specify a particular room, I will explore the room that is most likely to have these items, which is the living room.

Thought: The room name "living_room_1" is not valid. I will use the FindRoomTool to find a valid room name that might have the phone stand and the statue.

Thought: The FindRoomTool returned three possible rooms that might have the phone stand or the statue. I will explore each of these rooms to find the objects. I will start with the first room, tv_1.

Thought: I have successfully picked up the phone stand from the lounge_1 room. Now, I need to move the phone stand to the tv table, but it is not in the tv room yet. I should either navigate to the tv room with the phone stand or explore other rooms to see if the tv table is located in any of them. I will explore the tv_2 room.

Thought: I have successfully explored the tv_2 room, but I still didn't find the tv table. I will now return to the navigation to use the information I have so far to make a decision. I need to find the tv table to place the phone stand. I noticed in the description that the tv table is present in the tv_1 room. Since I have explored the tv_1 room and didn't find the tv table, this must mean that the tv table was not an object at the time of exploration but a piece of furniture. I need to re-examine the objects in the tv_1 room to see if the tv table was there.
