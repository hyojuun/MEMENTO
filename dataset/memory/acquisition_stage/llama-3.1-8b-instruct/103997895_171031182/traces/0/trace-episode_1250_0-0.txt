Task: Move the toy airplane from the bedroom to the living room table. Place it next to the couch. The toy airplane is red, part of the Air Hogs Wind Flyers Set. It's a gift from my childhood friend.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring a room where the toy airplane might be located. A common place for toys is the bedroom, so I will explore bedroom_1 first to see if the toy airplane is already there.

Thought: I have found a bottle in the bedroom, but I am still looking for the toy airplane. I will use the FindObjectTool to find the exact name of the toy airplane.

Thought: The FindObjectTool was unable to find any objects matching the query "toy airplane in bedroom_1". This means that the toy airplane is not currently in the bedroom or it is not recognized by the tool. Since I have not found the toy airplane yet, I will explore another room to see if it is in a different location.

Result: Incorrect syntax for place/rearrange skill. Spatial_constraint was valid, but corresponding reference_object was none. Ensure that the spatial constraint is required for rearranging this object, else try without it. Alternatively, the reference_object entity might be erroneous.. This may not be the correct node name, try using appropriate tool to get the exact name. If that doesnt work, this node may just not exist yet, explore the house to discover.
