Task: Move the statue and picture frame from the table in the living room to the shelves in the bedroom. Place them next to each other on the shelves. The statue is beige on a black base, and the picture frame is silver with an ornate border. The statue is a keepsake from my travels.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the living room to locate the statue and picture frame on the table.

Thought: I have found the statue and picture frame on the table in the living room. However, multiple objects were found, and I need to determine which ones are the statue (beige on a black base) and the picture frame (silver with an ornate border). I will use the DescribeObjectTool to get more information about these objects.

Result: The description of the object 'picture_frame_3' is:

Thought: The description of picture_frame_3 does not match the user's description of the picture frame as silver with an ornate border. I will continue to use the DescribeObjectTool to identify the correct picture frame.
