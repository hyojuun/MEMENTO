Task: Place the vase on the shelves, the candle on the table. I prefer to have the vase on the shelves and the candle on the table to create a cozy atmosphere in the room.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring a room that might contain a vase and a candle. The living room (living_room_1) is a common place for decorative items, so I will explore it first.
