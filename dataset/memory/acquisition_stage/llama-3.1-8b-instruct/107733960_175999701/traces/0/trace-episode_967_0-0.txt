Task: Move a book and a pencil case from the bedroom to the living room. Place them on the table. I usually keep my book and pencil case in the living room for my afternoon study sessions.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring a room that might contain a book and a pencil case. The bedroom (bedroom_1) is a common place for books and pencil cases, so I will explore it first.

Thought: I have explored the bedroom (bedroom_1) again and while I found a cup and bowl, I still have not found a book or a pencil case. I will now explore the drawer in the bedroom (chest_of_drawers_50) to see if I can find a book or a pencil case.

Thought: I have navigated to the chest_of_drawers_50 and explored it, but the result was the same, I did not find the objects I am searching. I realize now that I made an incorrect assumption about the object existing in the room. To continue, I need to find a good candidate for objects to pick. The last room I explored was the bedroom and I think it is worth exploring again. This time I will specifically look for the exact name of a book or pencil case.
