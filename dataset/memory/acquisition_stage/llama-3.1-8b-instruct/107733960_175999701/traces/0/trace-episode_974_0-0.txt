Task: First, put a clock next to the vase. Then, move both to the couch in the tv room. I usually keep the clock and vase together on the couch in the tv room to easily check the time while watching TV.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore a room to locate the clock and vase.

Thought: I have found the vase on the shelves in the living room, which is where the task instructions indicate it is. I also found the vase_1 on shelves_43, so now I need to describe it using the DescribeObjectTool to confirm if it is the correct vase.
