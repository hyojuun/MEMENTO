Task: Move the stuffed toy, basket, and picture frame from the bedroom shelves to the living room table. Place them next to each other on the table. The stuffed toy is cream-colored, resembling a dog with a long nose, the basket is a teal plastic Spritz Easter Basket, and the picture frame is black adorned with teardrop-shaped embellishments. The stuffed toy was a gift from my best friend.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore a room that might contain the cream-colored stuffed toy, teal plastic Spritz Easter Basket, and black picture frame. The bedroom shelves are a common place to find decorative items, so I will explore bedroom_1 first.

Thought: I have found the picture_frame_6 and stuffed_toy_4 in bedroom_2 on shelves_23. However, I was expecting to find the cream-colored stuffed toy, teal plastic Spritz Easter Basket, and black picture frame in bedroom_1. Since they are not in bedroom_1, I will explore bedroom_2 to see if they are there.
