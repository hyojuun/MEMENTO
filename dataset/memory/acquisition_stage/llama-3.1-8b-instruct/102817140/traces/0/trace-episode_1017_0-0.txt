Task: Move the lamp, vase, and picture frame from the living room table to the bedroom table. Place them next to each other on the bedroom table. The lamp is wooden with a white spherical shade, the vase is white with a narrow neck, and the picture frame is copper with a diamond pattern. The lamp is a gift from my grandmother.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the living room to locate the lamp, vase, and picture frame on the table.
