Task: Help me set up some visuals on the shelves. Move the picture frame and lamp there. The book can stay where it is. The lamp has a pineapple-shaped neon outline with a black base, and the picture frame is gold with a dark central image. The picture frame holds a special photo of my family reunion.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore a room that might contain the picture frame and the lamp. The living room (living_room_1) is a common place for decorative items, so I will explore it first.

Thought: I have found multiple objects in the living room, including the picture frame and the lamp. However, the picture frame and the lamp are actually located in the hallway (hallway_1) on table_30. I will navigate to the hallway to pick up the picture frame and the lamp.
