Task: Move the vase, candle holder, and picture frame from the living room to the office. Place them on the table. I usually like to have these items in the office for a calming and personalized workspace.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the living room (living_room_1) to locate the vase, candle holder, and picture frame.
