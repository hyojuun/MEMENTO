Task: Move the dumbbell, tennis racquet, and spray bottle from the workout table to the office table. I like to keep these items on the office table when I'm not working out to keep the workout area clear.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring a room that might contain the dumbbell, tennis racquet, and spray bottle. The workout area (workout_1) is a common place for these items, so I will explore it first.
