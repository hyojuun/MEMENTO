Result: After analyzing the scene, I can see that the query is asking for a table in the dining_room. Since the room name is singular ("dining_room" instead of "dining_room_1"), I assume it's an exact match in the database.

- table_25 in bedroom
- table_26 in dining_room is not present, however table_36 in office is present and then there is 
- table_30 in living_room and
