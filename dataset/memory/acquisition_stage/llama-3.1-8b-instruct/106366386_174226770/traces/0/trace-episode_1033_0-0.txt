Task: Move the candle holder, candle, and plant container from the dining table to the living room couch. Place them next to each other on the couch. In the evening, I like having these items together on the couch for a cozy atmosphere.
Thought: I need to find the objects (candle holder, candle, and plant container) that need to be moved, and since they are on the dining table, I should start by exploring the dining room to locate these objects.
