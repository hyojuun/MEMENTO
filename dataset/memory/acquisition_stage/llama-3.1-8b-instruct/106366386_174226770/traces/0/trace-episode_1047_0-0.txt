Task: Help me move some toys and a bowl from the dining room to the living room. Take the toy airplane, toy animal, and bowl from the table in the dining room. Place them next to each other on the table in the living room. The toy airplane is a red Air Hogs Wind Flyers Set, the toy animal is a detailed gray Schleich African Black Rhino, and the bowl is a black shallow bowl. The toy airplane and toy animal are part of my childhood collection.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the dining room to locate the toy airplane, toy animal, and bowl on the table.
