Task: Move the lamp and plant container from the bedroom table to the living room table. Place them next to each other on the table. I like having the lamp and plant container together on the living room table for a cozy evening ambiance.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring a room that might contain the lamp and plant container. The living room (living_room_1) is a common place for decorative items, so I will explore it first.

Thought: Since the lamp and plant container are not in the living room, I should explore the bedroom where they were found to pick them up and then move them to the living room.
