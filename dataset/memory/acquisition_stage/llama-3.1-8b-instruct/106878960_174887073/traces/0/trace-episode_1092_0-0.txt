Task: First, bring the jug from the kitchen to the dining room. Then, place it on the table. I usually have the jug on the dining table during meals for easy access to water.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring a room to locate the jug. I will begin with the kitchen, as it is a common place for a jug to be located.
