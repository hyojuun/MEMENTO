Task: First, move the candle from the dining table to the office shelves. Next, move the vase to the office shelves and place it next to the candle. I like to keep the candle and vase together on the office shelves for a calming atmosphere while I work.
Thought: Since the task requires moving the candle from the dining table to the office shelves, I should first explore the dining room to locate the candle.
