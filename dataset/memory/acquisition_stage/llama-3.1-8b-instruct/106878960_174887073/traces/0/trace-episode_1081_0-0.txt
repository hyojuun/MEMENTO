Task: Take the basket, can, and plant container from the kitchen cabinet to the dining table. I typically set them on the dining table for easy access when I'm organizing a centerpiece.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore a room that might contain the basket, can, and plant container. The kitchen (kitchen_1) is a common place for these items, so I will explore it first.
