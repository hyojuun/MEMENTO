Task: Move the toy airplane and then the toy vehicle from the bedroom shelves to the living room couch and place them next to each other. I like to have the toys on the living room couch for easy access when playing with the kids in the afternoon.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the bedroom to locate the toy airplane and toy vehicle on the shelves.
