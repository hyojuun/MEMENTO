Task: Move the toy airplane and toy vehicle from the TV table to the garage bench. Place them next to each other on the bench. The toy airplane is red and white with a pilot, and the toy vehicle is a blue toy train with a smiling face, Thomas & Friends Wooden Railway Talking Thomas. Both toys are part of my cherished collection.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the tv room to locate the red and white toy airplane with a pilot and the blue toy train with a smiling face, Thomas & Friends Wooden Railway Talking Thomas, as they are likely to be on the TV table.
