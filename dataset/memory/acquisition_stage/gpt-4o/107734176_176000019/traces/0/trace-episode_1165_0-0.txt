Task: Move the stuffed toy and the bowl to the kitchen and leave them next to each other on the counter. I always place the stuffed toy and bowl together on the kitchen counter as they are a part of my daily routine with my pet.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring a room where the stuffed toy and bowl might be located. A common place for a stuffed toy could be a bedroom or living room, and a bowl might be found in the kitchen or dining room. I will start by exploring the living room to locate these objects.
