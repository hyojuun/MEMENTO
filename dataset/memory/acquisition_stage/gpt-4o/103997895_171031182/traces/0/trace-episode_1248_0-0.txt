Task: Place the bread, the potato, and the egg on the kitchen table and place them next to each other. The bread is a round, dark brown loaf with slashes on top, the potato is brown with a smooth surface, and the egg is brown with a smooth surface. The bread is from my favorite bakery.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the kitchen to locate the bread, potato, and egg.
