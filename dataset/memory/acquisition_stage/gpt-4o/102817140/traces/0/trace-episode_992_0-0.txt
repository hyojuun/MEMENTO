Task: Move the candle holder, candle, and vase from the dining table to the living room shelves. Place them next to each other on the shelves. I prefer to have the candle holder, candle, and vase displayed together on the living room shelves for a cohesive look.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the dining room to locate the candle holder, candle, and vase on the dining table.

Assigned!
Result: Node with name dining_room_1 not present in the graph. This may not be the correct node name, try using appropriate tool to get the exact name. If that doesnt work, this node may just not exist yet, explore the house to discover.
Objects: No objects found yet
Thought: Since the dining room is not recognized, I should use the FindRoomTool to identify the correct name of the room containing the dining table.
