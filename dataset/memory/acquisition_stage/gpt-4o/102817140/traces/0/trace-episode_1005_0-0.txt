Task: Move the jug and cup to the table in the living room. Then, place them next to each other on the chair. After that, put the laptop on the table in the bedroom. I like to have the jug and cup together on the chair for easy access when I'm relaxing in the living room, and the laptop is usually in the bedroom for my work.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the kitchen, as it is a common place to find a jug and a cup.
