Task: Can we move the candle and vase from the living room table to the bedroom chest of drawers? The candle is white with a light blue base in a round holder, and the vase is black with white geometric patterns. The black vase was a special gift to me.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the living room to locate the white candle with a light blue base in a round holder and the black vase with white geometric patterns, as they are likely to be on a table in that room.
