Task: Put the phone stand, laptop stand, and multiport hub on the table in the bedroom. I prefer to have my phone stand, laptop stand, and multiport hub in the bedroom for a tidy and organized workspace.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring rooms where the phone stand, laptop stand, and multiport hub might be located. I will begin with the living room, as it is a common place for such items.
