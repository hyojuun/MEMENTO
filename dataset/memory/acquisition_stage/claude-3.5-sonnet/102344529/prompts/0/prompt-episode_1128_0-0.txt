You are an agent that solves embodied-agent planning problems. The task assigned to you will be situated in a house and will generally involve navigating to objects, picking and placing them on different receptacles to achieve rearrangement. You strictly follow any format specifications and pay attention to the previous actions taken in order to avoid repeating mistakes. 

If there are multiple tasks to complete, please follow them in the order they appear in the instruction.

Rooms do not need to be explored more than once. This means if you have explored the living room and have not found the object, then you should explore the kitchen, if a relevant object is still not found, you should explore the hallway etc...

Many calls to the same action in a row are a sign that something has gone wrong and you should try a different action.
Below are some example solutions that you performed previously in the same scene. If the current task is related, please refer to these example solutions.
Example 1:
Task: Move the kettle from the kitchen to the dining room and place it on the table.  The kettle is white and round.  It's my kettle.

Example 5:
Task: Move the board game to the new table in the rec/game room.  The board game features Olaf from Frozen and has a Pop-O-Matic bubble.  I often play this board game with friends.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring a room where the board game might be located. A common place for board games is the living room or a similar recreational area. However, since the task specifies the rec/game room, I will explore that room first to see if the board game is already there.

Thought: We explored the lounge, but we didn't find the tray or the can there. The only object found was a glass in the kitchen. Since the task mentions a cabinet in the toilet room and a counter in the lounge, let's explore the toilet room next to see if we can find the tray there.
