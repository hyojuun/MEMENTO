Task: Move the toy airplane and toy vehicle from the TV table to the garage bench. Place them next to each other on the bench. The toy airplane is red and white with a pilot, and the toy vehicle is a blue toy train with a smiling face, Thomas & Friends Wooden Railway Talking Thomas. Both toys are part of my cherished collection.
Thought: Since we haven't found any objects yet and the task mentions that the toys are on the TV table, we should start by exploring the TV room to locate the toy airplane and toy vehicle.

Thought: We have successfully explored the TV room and found several toys on table_14, including toy airplanes and toy vehicles. We need to identify which ones match the descriptions given in the task. Let's start by describing the toy airplane to find the red and white one with a pilot.
