Task: Move the candle and vase from the dining table to the tv couch? Place them next to each other on the couch. The candle is white and shaped like a gift box with a black bow, and the vase is brown with a gradient pattern. The candle is a gift from my best friend.
Thought: Since we need to move objects from the dining table, we should first explore the dining room to locate the candle and vase.
