Task: Move the phone stand to the tv table. Move the statue to the lounge counter. The phone stand is black with a minimalist design, and the statue is green of a sitting dog. The statue was a gift from my best friend.
Thought: Since we haven't found any objects yet, and we need to locate both a phone stand and a statue, we should start by exploring the tv room. This is because the task mentions moving the phone stand to the tv table, so it's likely that at least one of the objects we're looking for is in or near the tv room.

Thought: We've successfully explored the tv_1 room and found some relevant objects. We've located two statues on table_14 in tv_1, but we haven't found the specific green statue of a sitting dog yet. We've also found two phone stands, but they're in the lounge_1 area, not in the tv room. Let's use the DescribeObjectTool to identify which statue is the one we're looking for.

Thought: I've successfully placed the green statue of a sitting dog (statue_1) on the lounge counter (counter_42). Now, I need to move the phone stand to the tv table. We know there are two phone stands (phone_stand_0 and phone_stand_3) on the counter_42 in lounge_1. We need to identify which one is the black phone stand with a minimalist design. Let's use the DescribeObjectTool to get more information about phone_stand_0.

Thought: I've successfully picked up the black phone stand with a minimalist design (phone_stand_0). Now, I need to move it to the tv table. The task doesn't specify which tv table, so I'll assume it's the table in tv_1 since that's where we found the statue earlier. I'll navigate to tv_1 first.
