Task: Help me tidy up the hallway shelves. First, move the book, vase, and stuffed toy to the living room table. Place them next to each other. When tidying, I prefer to have the book, vase, and stuffed toy together on the living room table for a cohesive look.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the hallway to locate the book, vase, and stuffed toy on the shelves.

Thought: The exploration of hallway_1 didn't reveal the objects we're looking for. Since the task mentions hallway shelves, I should explore hallway_2 as well, as it might contain the items we need to move.
