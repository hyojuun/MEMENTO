Task: Move the toy airplane and then the toy vehicle from the bedroom shelves to the living room couch and place them next to each other. I like to have the toys on the living room couch for easy access when playing with the kids in the afternoon.
Thought: Since we need to find the toy airplane and toy vehicle in the bedroom, we should start by exploring the bedroom. There are multiple bedrooms, so let's start with bedroom_1.
