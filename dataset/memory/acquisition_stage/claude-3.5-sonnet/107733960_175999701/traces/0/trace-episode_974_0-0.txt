Task: First, put a clock next to the vase. Then, move both to the couch in the tv room. I usually keep the clock and vase together on the couch in the tv room to easily check the time while watching TV.
Thought: Since we need to put a clock next to a vase and then move both to the couch in the tv room, we should first explore the living room to find these objects. The living room is a common place for decorative items like clocks and vases.

Thought: Great, we've found both a vase (vase_1) and a clock (clock_0) in the living room on shelves_43. Now, we need to put the clock next to the vase. Since they're already on the same shelf, we just need to pick up the clock and place it next to the vase.
