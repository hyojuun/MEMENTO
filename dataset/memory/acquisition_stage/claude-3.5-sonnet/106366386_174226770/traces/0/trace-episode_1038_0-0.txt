Task: Move the jug and cup from the kitchen to the bedroom. Place them next to each other on the chest of drawers. I like having the jug and cup together on the chest of drawers in the bedroom for a convenient night drink.
Thought: Since we need to move objects from the kitchen to the bedroom, and no objects have been found yet, we should start by exploring the kitchen to locate the jug and cup.
