Task: Move the clock, then the vase, and finally the picture frame to the table in the living room. Then move them to the bench in the living room and place them next to each other. The clock is dark blue with a patterned face and a handle, the vase is tall and slender in dark green, and the picture frame is wooden with a colorful illustration inside. The vase is a gift from my friend.
Thought: Since we haven't found any objects yet, we should start by exploring the living room, as that's where we need to move the objects to eventually.
