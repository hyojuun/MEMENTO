Task: Help me prepare for lunch by moving the jug and cup from the kitchen counter to the dining table. Place them next to each other. I prefer having the jug and cup together on the dining table for easy access during lunch.
Thought: Since we need to move items from the kitchen counter to the dining table, we should start by exploring the kitchen to locate the jug and cup.

Thought: I apologize for the mistake. It seems we don't have a specific "dining_room_1" in our list of rooms. We need to find the correct name for the dining area. Let's use the FindRoomTool to locate the room where we might find the dining table.

No dining table was specifically found in the living room. However, I found the following tables in the living room which could potentially serve as dining tables:
