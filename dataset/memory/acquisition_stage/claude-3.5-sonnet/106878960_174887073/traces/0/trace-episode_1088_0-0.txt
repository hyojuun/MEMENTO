Task: Move the vase and then the plant saucer from the living room table to the hallway couch and place them next to each other. I prefer to have the vase and plant saucer together on the hallway couch for a decorative touch.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the living room to locate the vase and plant saucer on the table.
