Task: Move the lamp to the bedroom table. Move the statue to the living room shelves. I prefer to have the lamp on the bedroom table for reading and the statue on the living room shelves for display.
Thought: Since we haven't found any objects yet, we should start by exploring the living room to locate the statue that needs to be moved to the shelves.

Thought: We have successfully explored the living room and found a lamp on the shelves, but we haven't found the statue yet. We need to continue exploring other rooms to find the statue and also locate the bedroom table where the lamp needs to be moved. Let's explore the bedroom next.

Thought: We have explored both the living room and bedroom_1, but we haven't found the statue yet. We did find the lamp in the living room, so let's start by moving it to the bedroom table. First, we need to navigate to the shelves in the living room where the lamp is located.

Thought: Now that we're in bedroom_1, we need to find the exact name of the table where we should place the lamp. Let's use the FindReceptacleTool to locate the bedroom table.

Result: After looking at the scene I can tell that the furniture that match the query are:
- table_13 in bedroom
- table_22 in bedroom
- table_24 in bedroom
- table_25 in bedroom

Note: The query specifically asks for a table in "bedroom_1", but the available information doesn't distinguish between different bedrooms. I've listed all tables located in any bedroom.
Objects: lamp_0: held by the agent

Thought: We have found several tables in the bedroom, but we're not sure which one is specifically in bedroom_1. Since we're already in bedroom_1, let's choose table_22 as it's listed as being in a bedroom. We'll place the lamp on this table.
