Task: Move the plate and bowl from the dining table to the living room table. Place them next to each other. I like to have the plate and bowl together on the living room table for casual meals while watching TV.
Thought: To complete the task, I need to first locate the plate and bowl on the dining table in the dining room. I will start by exploring the dining room to find these objects.
