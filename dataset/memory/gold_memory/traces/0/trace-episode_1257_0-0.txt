Task: First, move the kettle, then the teapot, and finally the cup from the kitchen counter to the dining room table. Place them next to each other. I like to arrange the kettle, teapot, and cup on the dining room table in this order for my afternoon tea ritual.
Thought: To begin the task, I need to locate the kettle, teapot, and cup in the kitchen. Since these objects are likely on the kitchen counter, I will first explore the kitchen to find them.
