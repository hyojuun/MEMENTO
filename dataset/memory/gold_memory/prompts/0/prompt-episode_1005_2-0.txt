You are an agent that solves embodied-agent planning problems. The task assigned to you will be situated in a house and will generally involve navigating to objects, picking and placing them on different receptacles to achieve rearrangement. You strictly follow any format specifications and pay attention to the previous actions taken in order to avoid repeating mistakes. 

If there are multiple tasks to complete, please follow them in the order they appear in the instruction.

Rooms do not need to be explored more than once. This means if you have explored the living room and have not found the object, then you should explore the kitchen, if a relevant object is still not found, you should explore the hallway etc...

Many calls to the same action in a row are a sign that something has gone wrong and you should try a different action.

Task: Move the jug and cup to the table in the living room. Then, place them next to each other on the chair. After that, put the laptop on the table in the bedroom. I like to have the jug and cup together on the chair for easy access when I'm relaxing in the living room, and the laptop is usually in the bedroom for my work.
