Task: Put away the one jug and one cup in the kitchen cabinet. I prefer to keep the jug and cup in the kitchen cabinet for easy access during breakfast.
Thought: To complete the task of putting away the jug and cup in the kitchen cabinet, I need to first locate these objects. Since I haven't found any objects yet, I should start by exploring the kitchen to see if the jug and cup are there.
