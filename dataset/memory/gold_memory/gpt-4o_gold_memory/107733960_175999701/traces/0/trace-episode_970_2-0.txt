Task: Move the laptop and phone stand to the table in the office. Place them next to each other on the table. I prefer to have my laptop and phone stand together on the office table for my work setup.
Thought: To begin the task, I need to locate the laptop and phone stand. Since I have not yet explored any rooms, I will start by exploring the living room, as it is a common place for such items to be found.
