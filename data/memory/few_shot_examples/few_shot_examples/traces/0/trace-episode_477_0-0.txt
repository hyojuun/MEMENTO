Task: Move the board game to the new table in the rec/game room.  The board game features Olaf from Frozen and has a Pop-O-Matic bubble.  I often play this board game with friends.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring a room where the board game might be located. A common place for board games is the living room or a similar recreational area. However, since the task specifies the rec/game room, I will explore that room first to see if the board game is already there.
