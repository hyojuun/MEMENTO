Task: First, move the candle and candle holder from the bedroom chest of drawers to the tv room table ? Then place them next to each other on the couch. The candle is turquoise and cylindrical, and the candle holder is white with a gold rim. They are my favorite decoration pieces.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the bedroom_1 to locate the turquoise cylindrical candle and the white candle holder with a gold rim, as they are likely to be on the chest of drawers in that room.
