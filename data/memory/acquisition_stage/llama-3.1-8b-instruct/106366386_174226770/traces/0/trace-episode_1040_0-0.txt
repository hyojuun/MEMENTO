Task: Move the stuffed toy from the couch to the chair in the living room. Place it next to the table. I like to keep the stuffed toy next to the table on the chair for decoration and easy access during my reading time.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the living room to locate the stuffed toy.

Thought: I am now at the chair in the living room. I should place the stuffed toy on the chair next to the table.
Place[stuffed_toy_0, on, chair_32, next_to, table_14]
Assigned!<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>


Result: Unexpected failure! - No valid placements found for entity chair_32. It looks like the spatial constraint next_to is not feasible because the reference object table_14 either does not exist or has not yet been placed on the chair_32. Try placing the grasped object stuffed_toy_0 on chair_32 without the spatial constraint next_to.

Thought: Since the spatial constraint "next_to" is not feasible, I should place the stuffed toy on the chair without the constraint.
