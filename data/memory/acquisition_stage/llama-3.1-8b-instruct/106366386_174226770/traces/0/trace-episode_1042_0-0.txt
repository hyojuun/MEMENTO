Task: Move the stuffed toys and put them in the chest of drawers in the bedroom. I prefer to keep my stuffed toys in the bedroom chest of drawers for easy access and organization.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore a room to locate the stuffed toys. I will explore the living room, as it is a common place for children's items like stuffed toys.

Result: Since there is no "bedroom_1" specified, I will assume you meant to ask about the bedroom in general. After looking at the scene I can tell that the furniture that match the query are:
- chest_of_drawers_36 in bedroom
- chest_of_drawers_37 in bedroom
- chest_of_drawers_38 in bedroom
