Task: Put the shoe and pencil case on the bedroom chest of drawers. I prefer to keep my shoe and pencil case on the chest of drawers for quick access when I'm getting ready in the morning.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring a room that might contain a shoe and a pencil case. I will begin with the bedroom_1, as it is a common place for personal items.
