Task: Move the stuffed toy and the bowl to the kitchen and leave them next to each other on the counter. I always place the stuffed toy and bowl together on the kitchen counter as they are a part of my daily routine with my pet.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring a room to locate the stuffed toy and the bowl. As both are part of the daily routine, they are likely to be in a room where pets are present, which is typically the living room or a bedroom. However, living rooms often have other objects that might distract from the task, so I should first explore a bedroom.
