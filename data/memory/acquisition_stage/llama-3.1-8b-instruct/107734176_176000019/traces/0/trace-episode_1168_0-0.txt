Task: Move the jug, kettle, and bread from the kitchen counter to the living room table. Place them next to each other. The jug is dark green with a wavy top and abstract pattern, the kettle is white with a black handle and lid, and the bread is a loaf of brown. The dark green jug is my favorite item for serving drinks.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the kitchen to locate the jug, kettle, and bread.
