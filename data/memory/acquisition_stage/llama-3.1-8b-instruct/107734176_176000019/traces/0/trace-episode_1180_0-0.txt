Task: Move the stuffed toy and the bowl to the kitchen and leave them next to each other on the counter. The stuffed toy is a gray elephant with a soft, plush texture called Sootheze Cold Therapy Elephant, and the bowl is plain white. The elephant stuffed toy is from my childhood.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring a room where the gray elephant stuffed toy and the plain white bowl might be located. A common place for stuffed toys and kitchen items is the living room or the kitchen. However, since the task mentions the elephant stuffed toy from the user's childhood, it's likely to be in a room where personal items are stored, such as a bedroom. I will explore bedroom_1 to see if I can find the stuffed toy.
