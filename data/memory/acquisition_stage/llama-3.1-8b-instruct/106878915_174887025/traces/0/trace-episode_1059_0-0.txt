Task: Move the plant container from the living room table to the bedroom shelves. I prefer having my plant container on the bedroom shelves to create a calming atmosphere.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring a room that might contain the plant container. The living room (living_room_1) is a common place for plants, so I will explore it first.

Thought: Since I have found the plant container in the living room, now I need to move it to the bedroom shelves. I will first pick up the plant container to bring it with me.

Thought: Now that I am in the bedroom, I need to find a suitable location to place the plant container. I will use the FindReceptacleTool to find the exact name of a shelf in the bedroom.

Result: I do not have any information about a "bedroom_1". However, I can tell you that the furniture that match the query "a shelf in bedroom" are:
- shelves_12 in bedroom
- shelves_14 in bedroom

box_2: couch_18 in living_room_1

Thought: Since I have found two shelves in the bedroom, I will navigate to the bedroom to place the plant container on one of them. I will choose shelves_12 as the target shelf.
