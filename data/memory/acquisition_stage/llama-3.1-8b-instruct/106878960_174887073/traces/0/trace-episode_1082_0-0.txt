Task: Move the vase and stuffed toy from the dining table to the office shelves. Place them next to each other on the shelves. I prefer to keep the vase and stuffed toy together on the office shelves for a personal touch in my workspace.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the dining room to locate the vase and stuffed toy.

Result: There are no "office_1" spaces described in the furniture list. The closest match I found is "office" as a space. The furniture that match the query are:
- shelves_17 in office
Objects: vase_0: held by the agent
stuffed_toy_1: table_11 in dining_room_1

Thought: Since there is a match for "office" with shelves_17, I will use that to place the vase.
