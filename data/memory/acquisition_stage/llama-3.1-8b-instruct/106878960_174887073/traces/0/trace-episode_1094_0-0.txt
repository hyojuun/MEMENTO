Task: First, move the plate from the dining table to the chair. Then, place it on the table in the office. I typically move my plate to the office table to have my lunch while working.
Thought: Since the task requires moving the plate from the dining table to the chair, I should first explore the dining room to locate the plate.

Result: Since there is no "office_1" in the list, I will look for tables in the office. I found the following tables in the office:
- table_27 in office
- table_32 in office
- bench_31 in office (Note: bench is not a table, but I'm including it as it's in the office)
