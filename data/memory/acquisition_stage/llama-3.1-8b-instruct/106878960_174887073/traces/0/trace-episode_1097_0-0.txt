Task: Move the vase and stuffed toy from the dining table to the office shelves. Place them next to each other on the shelves. The vase is brown with a ribbed design, and the stuffed toy is blue with a textured pattern and a white snout. The stuffed toy is my favorite childhood toy.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring a room where the vase and stuffed toy might be located. A common place for decorative items like vases and stuffed toys is the dining table, so I will explore the dining room (dining_room_1) first.

Thought: I have found multiple vases and stuffed toys on the dining table in the dining room. I need to identify which vase is brown with a ribbed design and which stuffed toy is blue with a textured pattern and a white snout. I will use the DescribeObjectTool to get more information about these objects.
