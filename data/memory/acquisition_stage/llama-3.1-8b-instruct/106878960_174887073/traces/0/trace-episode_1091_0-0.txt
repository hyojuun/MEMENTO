Task: Move the plate and bowl from the dining table to the living room table. Place them next to each other. I like to have the plate and bowl together on the living room table for casual meals while watching TV.
Thought: Since the task requires moving the plate and bowl from the dining table to the living room table, I should first explore the dining room to locate the plate and bowl.

Since the objects in question were originally at the dinning room, I can try to navigate back to the dining room to find a suitable receptacle. Then I'll try to find a specific room and use the tool again to acquire the necessary spacial relation.
