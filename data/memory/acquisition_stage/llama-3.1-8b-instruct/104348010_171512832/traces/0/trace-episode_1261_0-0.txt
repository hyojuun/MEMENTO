Task: Move the stuffed toy, basket, and picture frame from the bedroom shelves to the living room table. Place them next to each other on the table. I like to have these items together on the living room table for an inviting and cozy decor.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore a room that might contain the stuffed toy, basket, and picture frame. The bedroom shelves are mentioned in the task, so I will explore bedroom_1 to locate these objects.
