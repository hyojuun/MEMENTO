Task: Move the vase and statue from the bedroom table to the entryway chest of drawers. Place them next to each other on the chest of drawers. I like having the vase and statue together in the entryway for a welcoming aesthetic.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore a room that might contain the vase and statue. The bedroom_1 is a common place for decorative items, so I will explore it first.
