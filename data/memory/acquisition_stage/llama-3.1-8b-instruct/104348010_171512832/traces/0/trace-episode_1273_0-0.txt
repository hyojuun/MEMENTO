Task: Help me tidy up the hallway shelves. First, move the book, vase, and stuffed toy to the living room table. Place them next to each other. The book has a colorful cover with architectural imagery, the vase is white with brown accents and a glossy finish, and the stuffed toy is a gray elephant with a soft, plush texture called Sootheze Cold Therapy Elephant. The vase is a gift from my friend.
Thought: The task requires moving the book, vase, and stuffed toy to the living room table and placing them next to each other. Since no objects have been found yet, I should start by exploring a room where these objects might be located.
