Task: First, bring the vase from shelves in the living room to the dining room. Then, place it on the table in the office. I often move the vase to the office table for a touch of decor while I work.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring a room to locate the vase. I will begin with the living room, as it is a common place for a vase to be located.
