Task: Move the toy airplane and then the toy vehicle from the bedroom shelves to the living room couch and place them next to each other. I like to have the toys on the living room couch for easy access when playing with the kids in the afternoon.
Thought: I should start by exploring a room to locate the toy airplane and toy vehicle. I will begin with the bedroom shelves, as they are mentioned in the task description.

Result: At first glance, it seems that there might be an issue since "living_room_1" seems wrong. I assume you meant to say "living_room" or "living_room_1" could be a typo.

Since it's a typo, I'll proceed with assuming you meant that the actual name is just "living_room".
