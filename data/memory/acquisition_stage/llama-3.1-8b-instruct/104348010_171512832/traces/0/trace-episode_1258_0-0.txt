Task: Help me tidy up the hallway shelves. First, move the book, vase, and stuffed toy to the living room table. Place them next to each other. When tidying, I prefer to have the book, vase, and stuffed toy together on the living room table for a cohesive look.
Thought: Since there are no objects found, I should explore a room that might contain a book, a vase, and a stuffed toy. The hallway shelf (shelves_32) is a common place to find decorative items, so I will explore it first.
