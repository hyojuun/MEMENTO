Task: Move a laptop and a laptop stand from the lounge counter to the dining room table. Place them next to each other on the table. I prefer having my laptop and stand on the dining room table for working in a comfortable setting.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring a room to locate the laptop and laptop stand. I will begin with the lounge (lounge_1) as it is a common place for laptops and stands.
