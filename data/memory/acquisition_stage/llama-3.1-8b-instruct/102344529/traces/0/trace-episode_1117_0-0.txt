Task: Move the candle and vase from the dining table to the tv couch. Place them next to each other on the couch. I like to keep the candle and vase together on the TV couch for a cozy atmosphere.
Thought: I need to locate the candle and vase to start the task, so I should explore the dining room where I often find candles and vases.
