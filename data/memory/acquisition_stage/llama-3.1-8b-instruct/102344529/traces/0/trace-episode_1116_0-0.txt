Task: Move the picture frame and vase from the dining room table to the tv shelves. Place them next to each other on the shelves. I like to keep the picture frame and vase together on the tv shelves for a cohesive look.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the dining room to locate the picture frame and vase.
