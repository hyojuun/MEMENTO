Task: Help me prepare a snack in the tv room. First, move the apple, knife, and plate from the dining room to the tv room table. Place them next to each other on the table. I usually prepare my snack on the tv room table for easy access while watching TV.
Thought: To start preparing a snack in the tv room, I need to move the apple, knife, and plate from the dining room to the tv room table. I should begin by exploring the room where these objects are likely located, which is the dining room.
