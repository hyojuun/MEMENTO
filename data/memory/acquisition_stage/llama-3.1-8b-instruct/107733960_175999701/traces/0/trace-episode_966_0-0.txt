Task: Move the laptop stand and multiport hub from the office table to the bedroom table. Place them next to each other on the table. I prefer to have my laptop stand and multiport hub together in the bedroom for my late-night work sessions.
Thought: Since I need to move the laptop stand and multiport hub from the office to the bedroom, I should start by exploring the office to find these objects.
