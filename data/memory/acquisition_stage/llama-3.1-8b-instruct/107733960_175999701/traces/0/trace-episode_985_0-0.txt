Task: First, put a clock next to the vase. Then, move both to the couch in the tv room. The vase is glossy black with a narrow neck, and the clock is gray with a rounded top and black numerals. The vase is a cherished family heirloom.
Thought:Given the task to move the clock next to the vase, and then move both to the couch in the tv room, I should start by finding the object "vase" in the house, as it is the first step in completing the task.

Thought:Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore a room that is likely to have the vase. The task mentions that the vase is a "cherished family heirloom", which suggests that it might be in a room where family items are kept. I will explore the living room, which is a common area where family members often gather.

Result: Unexpected failure! - No valid placements found for entity couch_23. It looks like the spatial constraint next_to is not feasible because the reference object vase_1 either does not exist or has not yet been placed on the couch_23. Try placing the grasped object clock_0 on couch_23 without the spatial constraint next_to.
