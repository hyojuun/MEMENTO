Task: Move a book and a pencil case from the bedroom to the living room. Place them on the table. The book has a cover image of a modern interior, and the pencil case is colorful with a paisley pattern, named Olive Kids Paisley Pencil Case. The book was a gift from a dear friend.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring a room that might contain a book and a pencil case. The bedroom (bedroom_1) is a common place for books and pencil cases, so I will explore it first.

Thought: I have found some objects in the bedroom, but none of them match the description of the book with a cover image of a modern interior or the pencil case with a paisley pattern. I will continue to explore the bedroom to see if I can find the objects I am looking for.

Thought: I have explored multiple chests of drawers in the bedroom and still haven't found the objects I am looking for. I have also explored other rooms in the house. Since I have explored the bedroom extensively, it is likely that the book and pencil case are actually in the bedroom, but in a different location or on a different piece of furniture. I should explore other objects in the bedroom to see if I can find them.
