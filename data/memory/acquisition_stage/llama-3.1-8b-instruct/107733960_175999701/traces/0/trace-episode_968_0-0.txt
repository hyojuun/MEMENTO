Task: Move the laptop and mouse pad from the office table to the bedroom chest of drawers. Place them next to each other on the chest of drawers. I prefer to have my laptop and mouse pad on the bedroom chest of drawers for evening work sessions.
Thought: Since there are no objects found, I should explore a room that is commonly associated with the task, such as a room where the laptop and mouse pad might be found. The office seems like a likely place to start.

Thought: Since I didn't find any objects in the office, I should explore another room that is commonly associated with the task. The living room is a common place for laptops and mouse pads, so I will explore it next.

Result: Unexpected failure! - No valid placements found for entity chest_of_drawers_50. It looks like the spatial constraint next_to is not feasible because the reference object laptop_0 either does not exist or has not yet been placed on the chest_of_drawers_50. Try placing the grasped object mouse_pad_1 on chest_of_drawers_50 without the spatial constraint next_to.
