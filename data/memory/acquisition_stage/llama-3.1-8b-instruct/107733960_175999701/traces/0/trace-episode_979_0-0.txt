Task: Move the laptop and mouse pad from the office table to the bedroom chest of drawers. Place them next to each other on the chest of drawers. The laptop is black with a backlit keyboard, and the mouse pad is black with a logo in the corner. The laptop is my personal work device.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the office to locate the laptop and mouse pad on the table.
