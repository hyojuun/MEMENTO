Result: Unfortunately, the query "next to chair_42" is an action or a spatial relationship query, not a simple "find me a piece of furniture" type of query. However, based on the provided information, I can try to infer a somewhat related answer.

I see that chair_42 is located in the "office" area. Since I don't have explicit information on the arrangement or spatial adjacency between furniture pieces, I can suggest that you might be looking for furniture that is also located in
Objects: phone_stand_1: held by the agent
laptop_0: table_61 in office_1
cup_2: shelves_44 in living_room_1
cushion_3: couch_45 in living_room_1
