Task: Move the candle holder and vase from the living room table to the office cabinet. Place them next to each other on the cabinet. I prefer to keep the candle holder and vase together on the office cabinet for a calming atmosphere while I work.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the living room to locate the candle holder and vase.
