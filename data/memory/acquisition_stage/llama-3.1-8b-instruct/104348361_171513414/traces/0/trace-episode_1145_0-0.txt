Task: Move the clock to a new living room table. Also, move the candle holder to a new living room table. The clock is brown and black with a green display, and the candle holder is white with a gold rim on a wooden base. The candle holder is a gift from my friend.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring a room that might contain the clock and the candle holder. The living room (living_room_1) is a common place where these items might be found, so I will explore it first.
