Task: Move the kettle and ladle from the office to the kitchen and place them next to each other on the counter. The kettle is black with a curved handle, and the ladle is black with a round scoop. The kettle and ladle are part of my cooking essentials.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the office to locate the kettle and ladle.
