Task: Move the kettle and ladle from the office to the kitchen and place them next to each other on the counter. I prefer to keep the kettle and ladle next to each other on the kitchen counter for easy access when I'm cooking.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the office to locate the kettle and ladle.
