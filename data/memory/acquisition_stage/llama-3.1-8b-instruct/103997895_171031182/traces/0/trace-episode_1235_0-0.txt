Task: Move the android figure to a new living room table. Also, move the action figure to a new living room table. The android figure is a black and white Android_Figure_Panda, and the action figure is a green and blue Leonardo from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. The Android figure is a collectible item.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring a room to locate the Android_Figure_Panda and the action figure. I will begin with the living room, as it is a common place for collectible items and action figures to be located.

Thought: I have found multiple objects in the living room, including the Android_Figure_Panda and the action figure. I need to identify which one is the Android_Figure_Panda and which one is the action figure from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. I will use the DescribeObjectTool to get more information about these objects.

Result: The description of the object 'action_figure_8' is:
A green and yellow dinosaur action figure, Dino_4.

Thought: The DescribeObjectTool did not mention the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles among the descriptions. The action figure I found is a green and yellow dinosaur action figure, named Dino_4, which is not the right object I am looking for. I need to identify the action figure from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Leonardo. I will now use the DescribeObjectTool on the other action figure I found, action_figure_1.
