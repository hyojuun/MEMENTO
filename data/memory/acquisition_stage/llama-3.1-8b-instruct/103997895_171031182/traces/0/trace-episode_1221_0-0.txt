Task: Take the book, pencil case, and multiport hub from the table in the living room and put them on the shelves in the bedroom, placing them next to each other. I like to keep my study materials together on the bedroom shelves for easy access when I'm working or studying in my room.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring a room that might contain the book, pencil case, and multiport hub. The living room (living_room_1) is a common place for books and other study materials, so I will explore it first.
