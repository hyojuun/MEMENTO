Task: Organize the bedroom. Put the vase, book, and clock on the chest of drawers. The vase is white with a beige geometric pattern, the book is a multicolored hardcover with a geometric design, and the clock is maroon with a green digital display. The book is a gift from my best friend.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore a room that might contain the vase, book, and clock. The bedroom_1 is a common place to find decorative items like vases and books, so I will explore it first.
