Task: Move the book and clock from the living room shelves to the bedroom chair. Place them next to each other on the chair. I prefer to have my book and clock together on the bedroom chair for easy access before bed.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the living room to locate the book and clock on the shelves.
