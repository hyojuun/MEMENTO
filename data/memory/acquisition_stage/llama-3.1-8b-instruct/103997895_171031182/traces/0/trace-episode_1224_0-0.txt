Task: Move the picture frame and clock to the table in the bedroom. Then, place them next to each other on the counter in the kitchen. I usually like to start my day by having the picture frame and clock together in the kitchen.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring a room that might contain the picture frame and clock. The living room (living_room_1) is a common place for decorative items, so I will explore it first.

Result: Unexpected failure! - No valid placements found for entity counter_29. It looks like the spatial constraint next_to is not feasible because the reference object clock_1 either does not exist or has not yet been placed on the counter_29. Try placing the grasped object picture_frame_0 on counter_29 without the spatial constraint next_to.
