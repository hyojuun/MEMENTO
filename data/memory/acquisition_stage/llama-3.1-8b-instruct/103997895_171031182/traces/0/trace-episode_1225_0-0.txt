Task: Move the vase, then the lamp, and finally the plate to the table in the living room. Then, move them to the couch in the living room and place them next to each other. I prefer to keep the vase, lamp, and plate together on the couch in the living room after rearranging them from the table.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore a room I haven't explored yet to find the vase, lamp, and plate.
