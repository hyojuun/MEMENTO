Task: Move the jug, cup, and plate to the living room table. I always like to have the jug, cup, and plate ready on the living room table for my afternoon tea time.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore a room that might contain the jug, cup, and plate. The kitchen (kitchen_1) is a common place where these items might be found, so I will explore it first.
