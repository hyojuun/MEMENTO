Task: Move the laptop and mouse pad from the table in the bedroom to the counter in the kitchen. Place them next to each other on the counter. The laptop is black and rugged with a gray touchpad, and the mouse pad is black with a logo in the corner. The laptop and mouse pad are part of my work setup.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring a room that might contain the laptop and mouse pad. The bedroom_2 is a common place for work-related items, so I will explore it first.
