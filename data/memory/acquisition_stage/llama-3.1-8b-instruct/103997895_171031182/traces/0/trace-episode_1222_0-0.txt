Task: Move the kettle and keychain from the kitchen cabinet to the bedroom filing cabinet. Place them next to each other on the filing cabinet. I like to keep my kettle and keychain together in the bedroom for convenience in the morning.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore a room that might contain the kettle and keychain. The kitchen (kitchen_1) is a common place where these items might be found, so I will explore it first.
