Task: First, take the stuffed toy from the bedroom to the laundry room/mudroom. Then, move it to the living room and place it on the couch. The stuffed toy is a blue and white shark. It is my favorite stuffed toy.
Thought: Since the task requires moving the stuffed toy from the bedroom to the laundry room/mudroom, I should start by exploring the bedroom to locate the stuffed toy.
