Task: Move the candle from the living room stand to the office chair and place it next to the table. The candle is blue and black with a textured pattern. This candle was a gift from my friend.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore a room where the candle is likely to be located. I'll start by exploring the living room, as it's a common space where decorative items like candles are often placed.
