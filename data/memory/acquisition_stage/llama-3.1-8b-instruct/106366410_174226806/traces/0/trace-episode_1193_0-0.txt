Task: First, move the phone stand and candle to the bedroom couch? Then, relocate them to the dining table and place them next to each other. Leave the doll on the living room couch. I like to move the phone stand and candle to the bedroom couch occasionally before finally placing them on the dining table next to each other for dining ambiance. The doll stays on the living room couch as part of the decor.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring a room to locate the phone stand and candle. I will begin with the living room, as it is a common place for these items to be located.
