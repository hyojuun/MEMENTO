Task: Help me tidy up the living room. First, move the vase and stuffed toy from the table to the couch. Place them next to each other. The vase is glossy gray with an elongated neck, and the stuffed toy is a yellow giraffe with a red bag. The vase is from my travel abroad.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the living room to locate the vase and stuffed toy.
