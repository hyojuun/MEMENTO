Task: First, move the lamp from the table in the bedroom to the counter in the kitchen. Next, move the jug to the counter in the kitchen and place it next to the lamp. I prefer to have the lamp and jug together on the kitchen counter for late-night snacks.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore a room that might contain the lamp and the jug. The bedroom_1 is a common place for lamps and jugs, so I will explore it first.
