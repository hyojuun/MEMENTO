Task: Help me prepare for lunch by moving the jug and cup from the kitchen counter to the dining table. Place them next to each other. I prefer having the jug and cup together on the dining table for easy access during lunch.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the kitchen to locate the jug and cup.
