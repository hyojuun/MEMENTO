Task: First, move the toy vehicle from the bedroom to the living room. Then, place it on the couch in the living room. I often keep the toy vehicle on the living room couch so it's easy to find when I want to play with it.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore a room that might contain the toy vehicle. The living room (living_room_1) is a common place for toys, so I will explore it first.

Thought: The explore skill took too long to finish, which means it was unable to find the toy vehicle in the living room. I should try a different room to find the toy vehicle.

Result: Incorrect syntax for place/rearrange skill. Spatial_constraint was valid, but corresponding reference_object was none. Ensure that the spatial constraint is required for rearranging this object, else try without it. Alternatively, the reference_object entity might be erroneous.. Use the appropriate tool to get a valid name.
