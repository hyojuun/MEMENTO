Task: Bring the book from the living room to the bedroom and place it on the chest of drawers. I prefer to keep the book on the chest of drawers in the bedroom for my bedtime reading routine.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring a room that might contain a book. The living room (living_room_1) is a common place for books, so I will explore it first.

Thought: Since the exploration of the living room took too long, I should explore a different room that might contain a book. The office (office_1) is another common place where books might be found, so I will explore it next.

Thought: Since the office (office_1) is not a valid room, I should use the FindRoomTool to find a valid room that might contain a book.
