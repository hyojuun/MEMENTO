Task: Help me tidy up the living room table. Move the clock, book, and candle to the stand? The book is black with gold accents, the candle has a brown and blue gradient, and the clock is round and white with black numbers and a brown frame. The book is a gift from my friend.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the living room to locate the clock, book, and candle.
