Task: Move the plant container from the bedroom table to the living room table. Take the stuffed toy from the kitchen cabinet and put it on a bedroom table. I like to have the plant container in the living room for better sunlight, and the stuffed toy should be on the bedroom table to add a cozy touch.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring a room that might contain the plant container and the stuffed toy. The living room (living_room_1) is a common place for decorative items, so I will explore it first.
