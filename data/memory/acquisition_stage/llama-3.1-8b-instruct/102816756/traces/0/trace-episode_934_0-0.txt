Task: Put the candle holder, statue, and vase back on the table in the bedroom. I prefer to have the candle holder, statue, and vase arranged on the bedroom table for a calming atmosphere.
Thought: Since the task is to put the candle holder, statue, and vase back on the table in the bedroom, I need to first find these objects in the current location. I do not have information on their current location, so I should start by exploring the rooms to locate them.

Thought: I was supposed to explore the bedroom_1, but it seems I ended up exploring the living_room_1 instead. Since I didn't find the objects I was looking for in the living_room_1, I should explore the bedroom_1 as planned.

Thought: I still haven't found the objects I'm looking for in the bedroom_1. This is unexpected, as the objects described in the task (candle holder, statue, and vase) should be in the bedroom. I will check the task details to see if there's anything I might have misunderstood.

Task: Put the candle holder, statue, and vase back on the table in the bedroom.

As I can still find the living room objects, it suggests that the other receptacles have the objects I am searching for. I should try to locate the statue and vase in the living room by using the Describe tool.

Thought: The description of the cup_4 doesn't match the objects I'm looking for (candle holder, statue, and vase). I will continue to use the DescribeObjectTool to identify the statue and vase by checking the remaining objects found in the living room.
