Task: Move the jug and cup to the table in the living room. Then, place them next to each other on the chair. After that, put the laptop on the table in the bedroom. I like to have the jug and cup together on the chair for easy access when I'm relaxing in the living room, and the laptop is usually in the bedroom for my work.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore a room that might contain the jug and cup. The kitchen is a common place for these types of objects, so I will explore it first.
