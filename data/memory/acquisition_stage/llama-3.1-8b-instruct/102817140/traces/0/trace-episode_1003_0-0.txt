Task: Move the book and pencil case from the living room table to the chest of drawers in the bedroom. Place them next to each other. I like to keep my book and pencil case together on the chest of drawers in the bedroom for late-night study sessions.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring a room that might contain a book and a pencil case. The living room (living_room_1) is a common place for books and pencil cases, so I will explore it first.

Result: Unexpected failure! - No valid placements found for entity chest_of_drawers_54. It looks like the spatial constraint next_to is not feasible because the reference object pencil_case_1 either does not exist or has not yet been placed on the chest_of_drawers_54. Try placing the grasped object book_0 on chest_of_drawers_54 without the spatial constraint next_to.
