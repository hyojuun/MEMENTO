Task: Help me set up some visuals on the shelves. Move the picture frame and lamp there. The book can stay where it is. I prefer to have the picture frame and lamp on the shelves to enhance the visual appeal of the room.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring a room that might contain a picture frame and a lamp. The living room (living_room_1) is a common place for decorative items, so I will explore it first.

Thought: I have explored the living room (living_room_1) and found some objects, but I did not find the picture frame and the lamp. I will now explore the hallway (hallway_1) to see if I can find them.
