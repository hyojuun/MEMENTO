Task: Place the laptop stand on the living room table next to the laptop. I prefer to keep my laptop stand next to the laptop on the living room table for easy access during work sessions.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring a room to locate the laptop stand and the living room table. I will begin with the living room, as it is a common place for a laptop stand to be located.
