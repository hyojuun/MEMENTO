Task: Move the book and pencil case from the living room table to the chest of drawers in the bedroom. Place them next to each other. The book is white with subtle yellow accents and a bookmark, and the pencil case has large white dots on an aqua background, named Big Dot Aqua Pencil Case. The book has my favorite notes.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore a room that might contain a book and a pencil case. The living room (living_room_1) is a common place for books and pencil cases, so I will explore it first.
