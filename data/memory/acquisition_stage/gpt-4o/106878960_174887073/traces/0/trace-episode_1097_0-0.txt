Task: Move the vase and stuffed toy from the dining table to the office shelves. Place them next to each other on the shelves. The vase is brown with a ribbed design, and the stuffed toy is blue with a textured pattern and a white snout. The stuffed toy is my favorite childhood toy.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the dining room to locate the brown ribbed vase and the blue stuffed toy with a textured pattern and a white snout, as they are likely to be on the dining table.

Thought: I have found multiple vases and stuffed toys on the dining table in the dining room. I need to identify the brown ribbed vase and the blue stuffed toy with a textured pattern and a white snout. I will use the DescribeObjectTool to determine which objects match these descriptions.
