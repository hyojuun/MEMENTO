Task: First, move the candle from the dining table to the office shelves. Next, move the vase to the office shelves and place it next to the candle. I like to keep the candle and vase together on the office shelves for a calming atmosphere while I work.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the dining room to locate the candle on the dining table.
