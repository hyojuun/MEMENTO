Task: Move the clock to a new living room table. Also, move the candle holder to a new living room table. The clock is brown and black with a green display, and the candle holder is white with a gold rim on a wooden base. The candle holder is a gift from my friend.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the living room to locate the brown and black clock with a green display and the white candle holder with a gold rim on a wooden base.
