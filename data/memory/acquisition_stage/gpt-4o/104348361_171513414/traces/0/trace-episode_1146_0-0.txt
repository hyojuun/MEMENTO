Task: Put the cup on the kitchen counter. Can you also move the laptop stand to a different kitchen counter? The cup is gray with a handle and two white birds design, and the laptop stand is black with foldable legs. The cup is my favorite mug.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the living room to locate the cup and the laptop stand.
