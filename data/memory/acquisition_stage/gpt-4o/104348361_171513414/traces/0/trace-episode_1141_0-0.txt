Task: First, move the jug from the kitchen counter to the living room table. Then, take the cup and plate from the kitchen cabinet to the living room table and place them next to each other. I usually set up the living room table like this for afternoon tea.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the kitchen to locate the jug, cup, and plate.
