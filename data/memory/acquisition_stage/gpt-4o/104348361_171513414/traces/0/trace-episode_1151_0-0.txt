Task: Help me prepare the laundry room for a cleaning session. First, move the vase from the washer dryer to the closet table. Then, take the stuffed toy and basket and place them next to each other on the chest of drawers. The vase is black and white with a speckled pattern, the basket is a blue Easter basket with rabbit ears, and the stuffed toy is blue with a friendly face. The basket is my childhood Easter basket.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the laundry room to locate the black and white speckled vase, the blue Easter basket with rabbit ears, and the blue stuffed toy with a friendly face.
