Task: First, move the phone stand and candle to the bedroom couch. Then, relocate them to the dining table and place them next to each other. Leave the doll on the living room couch. The phone stand is black with a minimalist design, and the candle is mint green with white butterfly designs. The candle was a gift from my best friend.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring a room to locate the phone stand, candle, and doll. I will begin with the living room, as it is a common place for decorative items like a phone stand, candle, and doll.
