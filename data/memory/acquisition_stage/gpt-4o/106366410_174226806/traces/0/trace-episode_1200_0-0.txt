Task: Move the dumbbell, tennis racquet, and spray bottle from the workout table to the office table. The dumbbell is green with a smooth finish, the tennis racquet is black with a brown handle, and the spray bottle is transparent with a sleek design. The dumbbell and tennis racquet are part of my personal workout gear.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the workout room to locate the green dumbbell, black tennis racquet, and transparent spray bottle on the workout table.
