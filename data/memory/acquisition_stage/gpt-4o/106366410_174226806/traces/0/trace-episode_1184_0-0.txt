Task: Organize the bedroom. Place the book, laptop, and candle holder back on the table. I prefer to keep the book and laptop on the table for easy access during the day, and the candle holder is always nearby for evening relaxation.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the bedroom_1 to locate the book, laptop, and candle holder, as they need to be placed back on the table in that room.
