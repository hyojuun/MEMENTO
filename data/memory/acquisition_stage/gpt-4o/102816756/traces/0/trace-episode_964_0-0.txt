Task: First, move the pen from the living room table to the shelves. Then, place it on the floor next to the bed in the bedroom. The pen is white with black accents. It's my lucky pen.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the living room to locate the white pen with black accents, as it is likely to be on one of the tables in that room.

Result: Unexpected failure! - No valid placements found for entity floor_bedroom_1.
