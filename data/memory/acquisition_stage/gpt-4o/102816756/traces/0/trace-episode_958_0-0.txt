Task: Put the plate and bowl together in another cabinet in the kitchen and place them next to each other. The plate is a square white plate with a black geometric pattern, and the bowl is a white bowl with a brown lid. The plate and bowl are part of my dinnerware set.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the kitchen to locate the square white plate with a black geometric pattern and the white bowl with a brown lid, as they are likely to be in the kitchen.
