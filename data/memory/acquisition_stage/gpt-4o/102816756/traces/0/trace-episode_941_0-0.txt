Task: Help me tidy up the living room. First, move the vase and stuffed toy from the table to the couch. Place them next to each other. I like to have the vase and stuffed toy together on the couch during cleaning for easy access later.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the living room to locate the vase and stuffed toy on the table.
