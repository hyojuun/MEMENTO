Task: First, move the toy vehicle from the bedroom to the living room. Then, place it on the couch in the living room. I often keep the toy vehicle on the living room couch so it's easy to find when I want to play with it.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the bedroom to locate the toy vehicle.
