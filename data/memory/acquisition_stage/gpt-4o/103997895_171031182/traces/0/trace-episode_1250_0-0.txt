Task: Move the toy airplane from the bedroom to the living room table. Place it next to the couch. The toy airplane is red, part of the Air Hogs Wind Flyers Set. It's a gift from my childhood friend.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the bedroom_1 to locate the red toy airplane, as it is likely to be in that room.
