The android figure is a black and white Android_Figure_Panda, and the action figure is a green and blue Leonardo from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. The Android figure is a collectible item.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the living room to locate the black and white Android_Figure_Panda and the green and blue Leonardo action figure, as they need to be moved to a new table in the living room.
