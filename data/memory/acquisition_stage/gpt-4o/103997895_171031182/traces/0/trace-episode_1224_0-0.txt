Task: Move the picture frame and clock to the table in the bedroom. Then, place them next to each other on the counter in the kitchen. I usually like to start my day by having the picture frame and clock together in the kitchen.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring a room that might contain the picture frame and clock. The living room is a common place for decorative items like picture frames and clocks, so I will explore it first.
