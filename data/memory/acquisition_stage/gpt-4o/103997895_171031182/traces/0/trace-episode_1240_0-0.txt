Task: Take the book, pencil case, and multiport hub from the table in the living room and put them on the shelves in the bedroom, placing them next to each other. The book is a hardcover with a colorful cover design, the pencil case is pink with large white dots called Big Dot Pink Pencil Case, and the multiport hub is gray with multiple USB ports. The pencil case is my favorite.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the living room to locate the book, pencil case, and multiport hub on the table.
