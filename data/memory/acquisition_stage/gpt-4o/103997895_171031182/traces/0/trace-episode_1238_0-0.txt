Task: Move the laptop and mouse pad from the table in the bedroom to the counter in the kitchen. Place them next to each other on the counter. The laptop is black and rugged with a gray touchpad, and the mouse pad is black with a logo in the corner. The laptop and mouse pad are part of my work setup.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring bedroom_2 to locate the black rugged laptop with a gray touchpad and the black mouse pad with a logo in the corner, as they are likely to be on the table in that room.
