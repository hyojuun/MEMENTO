Task: Move the laptop and laptop stand from the living room table to the bedroom chair. Also, bring a book from the bedroom chair to the living room table. I usually move my laptop and stand to the bedroom chair when I'm ready for work and keep a book on the living room table for quick access during breaks.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the living room to locate the laptop and laptop stand on the table.
