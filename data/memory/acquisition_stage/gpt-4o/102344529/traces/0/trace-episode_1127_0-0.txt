Task: Move the phone stand to the tv table. Move the statue to the lounge counter. The phone stand is black with a minimalist design, and the statue is green of a sitting dog. The statue was a gift from my best friend.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring a room where the phone stand and the statue might be located. I will begin with the tv room, as it is a common place for a phone stand to be located.
