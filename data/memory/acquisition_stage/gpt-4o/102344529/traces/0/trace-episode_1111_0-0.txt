Task: Move the kettle and tray from the laundry room/mudroom cabinet to the TV table. Place them next to each other on the table. I prefer having the kettle and tray on the TV table for easy access during movie nights.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the laundry room to locate the kettle and tray, as they are likely to be in one of the cabinets in that room.
