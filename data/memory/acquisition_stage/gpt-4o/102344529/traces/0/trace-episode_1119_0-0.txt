Task: Help me prepare a snack in the tv room. First, move the apple, knife, and plate from the dining room to the tv room table. Place them next to each other on the table. I usually prepare my snack on the tv room table for easy access while watching TV.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the dining room to locate the apple, knife, and plate.
