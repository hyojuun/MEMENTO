Task: Move the stuffed toy from the lounge chair to the porch chair. The stuffed toy is a brown and gray squirrel with a fluffy tail. This toy is a gift from my best friend.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the lounge to locate the stuffed toy, as it is likely to be on a lounge chair.
