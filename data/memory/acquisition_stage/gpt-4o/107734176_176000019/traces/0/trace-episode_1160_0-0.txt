Task: Move the vase and picture frame from the living room table to the lounge chair. Place them next to each other on the chair. I like to keep the vase and picture frame on the lounge chair as it creates a cozy decoration spot.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the living room to locate the vase and picture frame on the table.

Result: No lounge chair was found in lounge_1. I was able to find the following chairs in the lounge though:
- chair_19 in lounge, chair_20 in lounge, chair_43 in lounge, chair_44 in lounge, chair_45 in lounge

Thought: Since there is no specific "lounge chair" identified, I will place the vase on one of the available chairs in the lounge. I will choose chair_19 as the target for placing the vase.
