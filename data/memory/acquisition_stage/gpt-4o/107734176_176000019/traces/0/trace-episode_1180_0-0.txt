Task: Move the stuffed toy and the bowl to the kitchen and leave them next to each other on the counter. The stuffed toy is a gray elephant with a soft, plush texture called Sootheze Cold Therapy Elephant, and the bowl is plain white. The elephant stuffed toy is from my childhood.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the living room to locate the gray elephant stuffed toy and the plain white bowl, as these items are commonly found in living areas.
