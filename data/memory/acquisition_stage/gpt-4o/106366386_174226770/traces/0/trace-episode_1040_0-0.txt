Task: Move the stuffed toy from the couch to the chair in the living room. Place it next to the table. I like to keep the stuffed toy next to the table on the chair for decoration and easy access during my reading time.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the living room to locate the stuffed toy on the couch.

Place[stuffed_toy_0, on, chair_32, next_to, table_14]
Assigned!
Result: Unexpected failure! - No valid placements found for entity chair_32. It looks like the spatial constraint next_to is not feasible because the reference object table_14 either does not exist or has not yet been placed on the chair_32. Try placing the grasped object stuffed_toy_0 on chair_32 without the spatial constraint next_to.
Objects: bottle_1: shelves_24 in closet_1
cushion_3: couch_23 in living_room_1
stuffed_toy_0: held by the agent
Thought: Since the spatial constraint "next_to" is not feasible, I will place the stuffed toy on the chair without the spatial constraint.
