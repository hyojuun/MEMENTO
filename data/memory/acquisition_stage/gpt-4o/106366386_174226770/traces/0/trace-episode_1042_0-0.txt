Task: Move the stuffed toys and put them in the chest of drawers in the bedroom. I prefer to keep my stuffed toys in the bedroom chest of drawers for easy access and organization.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring a room to locate the stuffed toys. The living room is a common place for stuffed toys, so I will explore it first.
