Task: First, move the vase and statue to the other shelves in the living room. Then, place them next to each other on the table in the living room. I always like to keep the vase and statue together on the table for my morning meditation.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the living room to locate the vase and statue, as they are likely to be in that room.
