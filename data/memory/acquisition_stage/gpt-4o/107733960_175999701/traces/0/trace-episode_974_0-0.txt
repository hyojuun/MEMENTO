Task: First, put a clock next to the vase. Then, move both to the couch in the tv room. I usually keep the clock and vase together on the couch in the tv room to easily check the time while watching TV.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring a room to locate the clock and vase. I will begin by exploring the living room, as it is a common place for decorative items like clocks and vases.
