Task: First, move the vase and statue to the other shelves in the living room. Then, place them next to each other on the table in the living room. The vase is black with a bulbous shape, and the statue is a black dog. The black dog statue has been with me since my childhood.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the living room to locate the black bulbous vase and the black dog statue, as they are likely to be in that room.
