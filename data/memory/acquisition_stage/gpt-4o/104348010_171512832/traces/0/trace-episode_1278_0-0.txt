Task: First, bring the vase from shelves in the living room to the dining room. Then, place it on the table in the office. The vase is white with green and light blue leaves. It's a gift from my best friend.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the living room to locate the white vase with green and light blue leaves, as it is likely to be on the shelves in that room.
