Task: Put away the action figure and tray in the bedroom. Leave one action figure on the table. Take the tray and put it on the bed. I usually like to have an action figure on the table and the tray on the bed for easy access when I'm relaxing in the bedroom.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the bedroom to locate the action figure and tray.
