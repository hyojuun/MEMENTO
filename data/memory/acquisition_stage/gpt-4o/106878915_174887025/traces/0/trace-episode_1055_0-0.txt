Task: Move the toy airplane to the living room couch. Take the book and laptop to the living room table. I usually keep the toy airplane on the couch for playtime, and I prefer having the book and laptop on the living room table for study sessions.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring a room to locate the toy airplane, book, and laptop. I will begin with the bedroom_2, as it might contain the book and laptop.
