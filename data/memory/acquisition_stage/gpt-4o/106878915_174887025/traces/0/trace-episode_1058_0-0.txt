Task: Move the candle and book from the bedroom shelves to the living room table. Place them next to each other on the table. I like to have the candle and book together on the living room table for a relaxing reading session.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the bedroom_1 to locate the candle and book on the shelves.
