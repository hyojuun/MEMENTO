Task: First, move the laptop from the living room to the bedroom and place it on the bedside table. Then move the laptop from the bedside table to the stool in the bedroom. I usually start my work in the bedroom by placing the laptop on the bedside table, and then move it to the stool for a more comfortable working position.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the living room to locate the laptop.
