Task: Move the lamp to the bedroom table. Move the statue to the living room shelves. I prefer to have the lamp on the bedroom table for reading and the statue on the living room shelves for display.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the living room to locate the lamp and the statue.
