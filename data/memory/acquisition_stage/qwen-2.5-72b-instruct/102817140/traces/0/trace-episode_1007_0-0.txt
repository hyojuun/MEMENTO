Task: Move the lamp, then the vase, and finally the statue to the shelves. Then, move them to the table in the bedroom and place them next to each other. I usually arrange the lamp, vase, and statue on the bedroom table in this sequence for a calming bedtime atmosphere.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the living room to locate the lamp, vase, and statue.
