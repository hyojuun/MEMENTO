Task: Move the statue and plant container from the living room shelves to the bedroom chest of drawers. Place them next to each other on the chest of drawers. I like to have the statue and plant container together on the bedroom chest of drawers for a decorative touch.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the living room to locate the statue and plant container on the shelves.
