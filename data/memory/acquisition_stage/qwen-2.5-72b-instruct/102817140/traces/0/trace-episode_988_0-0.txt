Task: Help me set up some visuals on the shelves. Move the picture frame and lamp there. The book can stay where it is. I prefer to have the picture frame and lamp on the shelves to enhance the visual appeal of the room.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the living room to locate the picture frame and lamp.
