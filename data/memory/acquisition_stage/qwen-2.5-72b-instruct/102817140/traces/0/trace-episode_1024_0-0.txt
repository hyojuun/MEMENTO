Task: Move the dumbbell and shoe to the shelves in the living room and place them next to each other. The dumbbell is black and hexagonal with a metal handle, and the shoe is a black and pink running shoe, PureConnect 2. The shoe is part of my favorite running gear.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the living room to locate the black and hexagonal dumbbell with a metal handle and the black and pink running shoe, PureConnect 2.
