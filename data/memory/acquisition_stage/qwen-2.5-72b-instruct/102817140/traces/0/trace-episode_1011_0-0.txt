Task: Can we move the candle and vase from the living room table to the bedroom chest of drawers? The candle is white with a light blue base in a round holder, and the vase is black with white geometric patterns. The black vase was a special gift to me.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the living room to locate the white candle with a light blue base and the black vase with white geometric patterns.

Thought: I have found multiple candles and vases on table_10 in the living room. I need to identify the specific candle and vase described in the task. I will use the DescribeObjectTool to determine which objects match the descriptions.
