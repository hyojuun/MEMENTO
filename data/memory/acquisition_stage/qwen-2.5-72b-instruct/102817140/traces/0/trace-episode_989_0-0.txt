Task: Can we move the candle and vase from the living room table to the bedroom chest of drawers? I enjoy having the candle and vase on the bedroom chest of drawers for a relaxing ambiance.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the living room to locate the candle and vase on the table.
