Task: Move the lamp and plant container from the bedroom table to the living room table. Place them next to each other on the table. I like having the lamp and plant container together on the living room table for a cozy evening ambiance.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the bedroom_1 to locate the lamp and plant container on the table.

Thought: The exploration of bedroom_1 did not yield the lamp or plant container. I should explore another bedroom, specifically bedroom_2, to locate these items.
