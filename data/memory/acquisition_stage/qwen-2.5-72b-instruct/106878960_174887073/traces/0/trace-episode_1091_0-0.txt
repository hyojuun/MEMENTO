Task: Move the plate and bowl from the dining table to the living room table. Place them next to each other. I like to have the plate and bowl together on the living room table for casual meals while watching TV.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the dining room to locate the plate and bowl on the dining table.
