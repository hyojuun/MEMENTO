Task: First, move the jug from the kitchen counter to the living room table. Then, take the cup and plate from the kitchen cabinet to the living room table and place them next to each other. The jug is blue with a round lid, the cup is yellow with a white interior, and the plate is plain white with a smooth, circular design. The jug and cup are from my preferred kitchenware collection.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the kitchen to locate the blue jug with a round lid, the yellow cup with a white interior, and the plain white plate with a smooth, circular design.
