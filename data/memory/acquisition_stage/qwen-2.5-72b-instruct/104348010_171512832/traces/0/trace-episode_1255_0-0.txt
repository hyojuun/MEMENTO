Task: Put away the action figure and tray in the bedroom. Leave one action figure on the table. Take the tray and put it on the bed. I usually like to have an action figure on the table and the tray on the bed for easy access when I'm relaxing in the bedroom.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the bedroom_1 to locate the action figure and tray.

However, the specific mention of "bedroom_1" is not detailed in the provided list. There are beds in the bedroom, but without more specific information, I cannot determine which one belongs to bedroom_1. Here are the beds found in the bedroom:
- bed_21 in bedroom
- bed_57 in bedroom
