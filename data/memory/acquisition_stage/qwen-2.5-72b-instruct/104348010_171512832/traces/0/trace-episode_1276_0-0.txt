Task: Move the stuffed toy, basket, and picture frame from the bedroom shelves to the living room table. Place them next to each other on the table. The stuffed toy is cream-colored, resembling a dog with a long nose, the basket is a teal plastic Spritz Easter Basket, and the picture frame is black adorned with teardrop-shaped embellishments. The stuffed toy was a gift from my best friend.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the bedroom to locate the stuffed toy, basket, and picture frame on the shelves.
