Task: Move the plate and bowl from the dining table to the kitchen counter. Place them next to each other on the counter. The plate is a white square and the bowl is gray with a faceted design. The plate and bowl are part of my everyday dinnerware set.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the dining room to locate the white square plate and the gray bowl with a faceted design.
