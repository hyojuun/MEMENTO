Task: Move the plant container from the bedroom table to the living room table. Take the stuffed toy from the kitchen cabinet and put it on a bedroom table. The plant container is a colorful assortment of electric pots by Cole Hardware, and the stuffed toy is a gray bear with a paw print on its scarf. The stuffed toy bear is a gift from my friend.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the bedroom where the plant container is likely to be located. I will explore bedroom_1 first.

Thought: The exploration of the living room did not complete successfully, but it provided information about the locations of the plant container and the stuffed toy. The plant container is in bedroom_3 on table_77, and the stuffed toy is in the kitchen in cabinet_76. I will start by moving the plant container from bedroom_3 to the living room.
