Task: Bring the book from the living room to the bedroom and place it on the chest of drawers. The book is white with subtle yellow accents and a bookmark. This book was a gift from my friend.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the living room to locate the white book with subtle yellow accents and a bookmark.

Thought: The exploration of the living room took too long, but it did reveal two books on table_48. I need to identify which one is the white book with subtle yellow accents and a bookmark. I will use the DescribeObjectTool to get more information about these books.

Thought: The description of book_2 does not match the white book with subtle yellow accents and a bookmark. I will now describe book_0 to see if it matches the description.
