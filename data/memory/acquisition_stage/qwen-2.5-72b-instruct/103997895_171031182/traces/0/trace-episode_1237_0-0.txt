Task: Organize the bedroom. Put the vase, book, and clock on the chest of drawers. The vase is white with a beige geometric pattern, the book is a multicolored hardcover with a geometric design, and the clock is maroon with a green digital display. The book is a gift from my best friend.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the bedroom to locate the vase, book, and clock.
