Task: Move the toy airplane from the bedroom to the living room table. Place it next to the couch. The toy airplane is red, part of the Air Hogs Wind Flyers Set. It's a gift from my childhood friend.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the bedroom to locate the red toy airplane from the Air Hogs Wind Flyers Set.
