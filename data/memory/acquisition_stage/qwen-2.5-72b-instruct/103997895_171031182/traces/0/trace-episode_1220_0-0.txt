Task: Move the jug, cup, and plate to the living room table. I always like to have the jug, cup, and plate ready on the living room table for my afternoon tea time.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the kitchen_1 to locate the jug, cup, and plate, as these items are commonly found in the kitchen.
