Task: First, take the teapot from the kitchen and put it on the couch in the living room. Then move it to the table in the bedroom. The teapot is black with a curved spout and an ornate lid. This teapot is a gift from my grandfather.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the kitchen to locate the black teapot with a curved spout and an ornate lid.
