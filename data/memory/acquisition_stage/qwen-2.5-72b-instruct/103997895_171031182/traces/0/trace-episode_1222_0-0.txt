Task: Move the kettle and keychain from the kitchen cabinet to the bedroom filing cabinet. Place them next to each other on the filing cabinet. I like to keep my kettle and keychain together in the bedroom for convenience in the morning.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the kitchen to locate the kettle and keychain, as they are mentioned to be in the kitchen cabinet.
