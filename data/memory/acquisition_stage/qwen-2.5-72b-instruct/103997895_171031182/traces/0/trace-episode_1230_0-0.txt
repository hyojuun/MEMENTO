Task: Move the toy airplane from the bedroom to the living room table. Place it next to the couch. I like to keep the toy airplane next to the couch so I can easily play with it while relaxing.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the bedroom_1 to locate the toy airplane.

Assigned!<|im_end|><|im_start|>user<|im_end|>

Result: Unexpected failure! - No valid placements found for entity table_19. It looks like the spatial constraint next_to is not feasible because the reference object couch_21 either does not exist or has not yet been placed on the table_19. Try placing the grasped object toy_airplane_0 on table_19 without the spatial constraint next_to.
