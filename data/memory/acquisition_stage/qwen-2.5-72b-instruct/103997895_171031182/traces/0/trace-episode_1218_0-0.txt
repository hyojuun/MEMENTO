Task: Organize the bedroom. Put the vase, book, and clock on the chest of drawers. I prefer to have the vase, book, and clock neatly arranged on the chest of drawers for a tidy look.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the bedroom_1 to locate the vase, book, and clock.

Thought: The exploration of bedroom_1 did not reveal the vase, book, or clock. I will now explore the living_room_1, as it is another common place where these items might be found.
