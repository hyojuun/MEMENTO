Task: First, move the candle and then the vase from the living room shelves to the bathroom toilet. Place them next to each other on the toilet. I typically keep the candle and vase together on the bathroom toilet for a calming atmosphere.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the living room to locate the candle and vase on the shelves.
