Task: Move the jug, cup, and plate to the living room table. The jug is dark green with a rounded base, the cup is dark blue with a dandelion design, and the plate is plain white with a smooth, circular design. The cup and the plate are part of my favorite set.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the kitchen to locate the jug, cup, and plate.

Thought: I have found multiple cups, plates, and jugs on the counter in the kitchen. I need to identify the specific objects that match the descriptions provided: a dark green jug with a rounded base, a dark blue cup with a dandelion design, and a plain white plate with a smooth, circular design. I will use the DescribeObjectTool to determine which objects match these descriptions.
