Task: Move the laptop and the mouse pad to a new living room table. Move the clock to another shelf. The laptop is black with a dark keyboard and a large touchpad, and the mouse pad is black with a logo in the corner. The clock is red with a white face and black numbers. The laptop is essential for my work.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the living room to locate the laptop and mouse pad, as they are likely to be there.
