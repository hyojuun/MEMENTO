Task: Move the android figure to a new living room table. Also, move the action figure to a new living room table. The android figure is a black and white Android_Figure_Panda, and the action figure is a green and blue Leonardo from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. The Android figure is a collectible item.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the living room to locate the android figure and the action figure.
