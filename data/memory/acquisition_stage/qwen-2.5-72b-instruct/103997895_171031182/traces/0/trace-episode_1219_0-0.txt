Task: Move the laptop and mouse pad from the table in the bedroom to the counter in the kitchen. Place them next to each other on the counter. I like to keep my laptop and mouse pad on the kitchen counter for morning work sessions.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the bedroom to locate the laptop and mouse pad on the table.
