Task: Move the stuffed toy and the bowl to the kitchen and leave them next to each other on the counter. I always place the stuffed toy and bowl together on the kitchen counter as they are a part of my daily routine with my pet.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore a room where the stuffed toy and the bowl might be located. The living room (living_room_1) is a common place for such items, so I will start there.

Thought: Since the living room did not contain the objects, I will explore the bedroom (bedroom_1) next, as it is another common place where a stuffed toy and a bowl might be found.
