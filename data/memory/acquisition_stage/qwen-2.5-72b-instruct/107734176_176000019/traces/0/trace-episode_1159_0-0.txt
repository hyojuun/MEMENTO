Task: Put away the clock and vase by setting them on the washing machine. Set them next to each other. I prefer to keep the clock and vase together on the washing machine for easy access when I do laundry.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring a room that might contain the clock and vase. The living room (living_room_1) is a common place for such items, so I will explore it first.

Thought: I have found the clock and vase on table_15 in the living room. I will first pick up the clock and then move it to the washing machine in the laundry room.
