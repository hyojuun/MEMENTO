Task: Move the vase and picture frame from the living room table to the lounge chair. Place them next to each other on the chair. The vase is dark blue with a faceted design, and the picture frame has a light blue border with multicolored accents. The dark blue vase is my personal favorite.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the living room to locate the dark blue vase and the picture frame with a light blue border and multicolored accents.
