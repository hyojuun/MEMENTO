Task: First, put a clock next to the vase. Then, move both to the couch in the tv room. I usually keep the clock and vase together on the couch in the tv room to easily check the time while watching TV.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the living room to locate the clock and vase, as they are likely to be found there.
