Task: Move the laptop and phone stand to the table in the office. Place them next to each other on the table. I prefer to have my laptop and phone stand together on the office table for my work setup.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring a room that might contain the laptop and phone stand. The living room (living_room_1) is a common place for such items, so I will explore it first.

Thought: The living room did not contain the laptop or phone stand. However, the result indicates that both the laptop and phone stand are located in the kitchen (cabinet_65). I will navigate to the kitchen to pick them up.
