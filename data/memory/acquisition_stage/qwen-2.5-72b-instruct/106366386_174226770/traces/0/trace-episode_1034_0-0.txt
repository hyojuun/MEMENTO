Task: Put away the one jug and one cup in the kitchen cabinet. I prefer to keep the jug and cup in the kitchen cabinet for easy access during breakfast.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the kitchen to locate the jug and cup that need to be put away in the kitchen cabinet.
