Task: Move the toy airplane and toy vehicle from the closet shelves to the living room table. Place them next to each other on the table. I like to have the toy airplane and toy vehicle displayed together on the living room table for easy access when playing with them.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the closet_1 to locate the toy airplane and toy vehicle on the shelves.

Note: The query specifies "living_room_1," but the tables are listed under "living_room." Assuming "living_room" and "living_room_1" refer to the same area, these tables match your query.
