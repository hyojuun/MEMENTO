Task: Help me move some toys and a bowl from the dining room to the living room. Take the toy airplane, toy animal, and bowl from the table in the dining room. Place them next to each other on the table in the living room. I enjoy having these toys and the bowl set up together in the living room for playtime with my child.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the dining room to locate the toy airplane, toy animal, and bowl on the table.
