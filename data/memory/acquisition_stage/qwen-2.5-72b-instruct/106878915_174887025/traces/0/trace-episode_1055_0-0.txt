Task: Move the toy airplane to the living room couch. Take the book and laptop to the living room table. I usually keep the toy airplane on the couch for playtime, and I prefer having the book and laptop on the living room table for study sessions.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring a room that might contain the toy airplane, book, and laptop. The bedroom is a common place for these items, so I will explore bedroom_1 first.
