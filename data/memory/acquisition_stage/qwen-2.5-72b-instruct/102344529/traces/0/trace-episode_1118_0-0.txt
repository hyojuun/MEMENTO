Task: Take the clock, vase, and candle from the table in the dining room and put them on the shelves in the TV room, placing them next to each other. I prefer to keep the clock, vase, and candle together on the shelves in the TV room to create a cozy atmosphere.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the dining room to locate the clock, vase, and candle on the table.

Result: - shelves_38 in tv

However, the query specifically asks for shelves in tv_2. The information provided does not specify which TV room (tv or tv_2) the shelves are in. Based on the available data, there is a set of shelves in the TV area, but it is not clear if this is the same as tv_2. 

If you need more specific information, please clarify the location or use a tool to query the exact location of the shelves.
