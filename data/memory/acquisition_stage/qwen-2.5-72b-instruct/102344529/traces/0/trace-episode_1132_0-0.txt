Task: Take the clock, vase, and candle from the table in the dining room and put them on the shelves in the tv room, placing them next to each other? The clock is a black vintage one with a round face and a small ring on top, the vase is colorful with a geometric mosaic pattern, and the candle is white on a black, geometric holder. The clock was a gift from my grandmother.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the dining room to locate the clock, vase, and candle on the table.
