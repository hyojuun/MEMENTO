Task: Move the candle and vase from the dining table to the tv couch? Place them next to each other on the couch. The candle is white and shaped like a gift box with a black bow, and the vase is brown with a gradient pattern. The candle is a gift from my best friend.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the dining room to locate the candle and vase on the dining table.
