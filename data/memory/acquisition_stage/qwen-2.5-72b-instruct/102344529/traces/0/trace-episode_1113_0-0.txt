Task: Move a laptop and a laptop stand from the lounge counter to the dining room table. Place them next to each other on the table. I prefer having my laptop and stand on the dining room table for working in a comfortable setting.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the lounge to locate the laptop and laptop stand on the counter.

However, the specific identifier "dining_room_1" was not found in the list of floors. The tables are located in the dining room, but there is no distinction between different dining rooms based on the provided information.
