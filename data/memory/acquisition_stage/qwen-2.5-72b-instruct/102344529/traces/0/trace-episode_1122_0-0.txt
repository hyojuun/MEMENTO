Task: First, move the candle from the table to the chair in the tv room. Then, place it on the tv table. I usually reposition the candle in this way to prepare for a cozy evening.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the tv room to locate the candle on the table.

Thought: The FindReceptacleTool provided several tables in the tv area, but I need to be more specific. I will use the FindObjectTool to find the exact name of the tv table in tv_1.
