Task: Move the kettle and tray from the laundry room/mudroom cabinet to the TV table. Place them next to each other on the table. I prefer having the kettle and tray on the TV table for easy access during movie nights.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the laundryroom_1 to locate the kettle and tray in the cabinets.
