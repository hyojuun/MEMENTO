Task: First, put a clock next to the vase. Then, move both to the couch in the tv room. The vase is glossy black with a narrow neck, and the clock is gray with a rounded top and black numerals. The vase is a cherished family heirloom.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the living room to locate the vase and clock.
