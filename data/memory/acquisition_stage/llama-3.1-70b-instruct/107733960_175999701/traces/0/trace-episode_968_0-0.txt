Task: Move the laptop and mouse pad from the office table to the bedroom chest of drawers. Place them next to each other on the chest of drawers. I prefer to have my laptop and mouse pad on the bedroom chest of drawers for evening work sessions.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the office to locate the laptop and mouse pad.
