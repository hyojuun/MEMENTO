Task: First, move the vase and statue to the other shelves in the living room. Then, place them next to each other on the table in the living room. I always like to keep the vase and statue together on the table for my morning meditation.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the living room to locate the vase and statue, as they are likely to be on the shelves in that room.

Thought: I have found the vase and statue on shelves_44 in the living room. The task requires me to move them to the other shelves in the living room. Since there are two shelves in the living room (shelves_43 and shelves_44), and the vase and statue are currently on shelves_44, I will move them to shelves_43.
