Task: Move the book and clock from the living room shelves to the bedroom chair. Place them next to each other on the chair. The book has a dark cover featuring a portrait with teal text, and the clock is blue with rabbit ears and feet. The clock is a gift from my brother.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the living room to locate the book and clock on the shelves.

Thought: I have found multiple clocks and books on the shelves in the living room. I need to identify which clock is the blue one with rabbit ears and feet, and which book has a dark cover featuring a portrait with teal text. I will use the DescribeObjectTool to get more information about these objects.
