Task: Move the laptop and the mouse pad to a new living room table. Move the clock to another shelf. The laptop is black with a dark keyboard and a large touchpad, and the mouse pad is black with a logo in the corner. The clock is red with a white face and black numbers. The laptop is essential for my work.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the living room to locate the laptop, mouse pad, and clock.

Thought: I have found multiple laptops in the living room, laptop_0 and laptop_7. I need to determine which one is the black laptop with a dark keyboard and a large touchpad. I will use the DescribeObjectTool to get more information about these laptops.
