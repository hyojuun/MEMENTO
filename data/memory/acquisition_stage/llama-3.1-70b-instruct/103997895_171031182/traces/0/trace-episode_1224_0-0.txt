Task: Move the picture frame and clock to the table in the bedroom. Then, place them next to each other on the counter in the kitchen. I usually like to start my day by having the picture frame and clock together in the kitchen.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the living room to locate the picture frame and clock.
