Task: Move the jug, cup, and plate to the living room table. The jug is dark green with a rounded base, the cup is dark blue with a dandelion design, and the plate is plain white with a smooth, circular design. The cup and the plate are part of my favorite set.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the kitchen to locate the jug, cup, and plate.
