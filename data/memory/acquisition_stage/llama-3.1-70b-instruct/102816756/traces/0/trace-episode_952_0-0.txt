Task: Move the plant container from the bedroom table to the living room table. Take the stuffed toy from the kitchen cabinet and put it on a bedroom table. The plant container is a colorful assortment of electric pots by Cole Hardware, and the stuffed toy is a gray bear with a paw print on its scarf. The stuffed toy bear is a gift from my friend.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore a room that might contain the plant container, which is a colorful assortment of electric pots by Cole Hardware. A common place for plants is the bedroom, so I will explore the bedroom first to see if the plant container is already there.

Thought: Since the bedroom_1 did not contain the plant container, I will explore another room that might contain the plant container. A common place for plants is also the living room, but the task specifies that the plant container needs to be moved to the living room table, so it is likely that the plant container is in one of the bedrooms. I will explore bedroom_2 next.
