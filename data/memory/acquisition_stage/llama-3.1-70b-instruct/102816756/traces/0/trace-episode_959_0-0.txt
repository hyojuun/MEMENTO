Task: First, move the toy vehicle from the bedroom to the living room. Then, place it on the couch in the living room. The toy vehicle is a green toy train with red and black details, called Thomas Friends Wooden Railway Henry. This toy train was my favorite childhood toy.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the bedroom to locate the green toy train with red and black details, called Thomas Friends Wooden Railway Henry.
