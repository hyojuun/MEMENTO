Task: First, move the pen from the living room table to the shelves. Then, place it on the floor next to the bed in the bedroom. The pen is white with black accents. It's my lucky pen.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the living room to locate the white pen with black accents.

Result: Unexpected failure! - Skill took too long to finish.

pen_3: table_38 in living_room_1

<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Thought: Although the exploration of the living room took too long, I was able to find two pens on table_38 in the living room. I need to identify which one is the white pen with black accents that belongs to the user. I will use the DescribeObjectTool to get more information about these pens.

DescribeObjectTool[pen_0]
Assigned!<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>


Result: The description of the object 'pen_0' is:
A white pen with black accents.

pen_3: table_38 in living_room_1
spray_bottle_1: chair_42 in bedroom_1
<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Thought: I have identified that pen_0 is the white pen with black accents that belongs to the user. Now, I need to pick up the pen_0 from table_38 in the living room.

Thought: Since I am not close enough to the pen_0 to pick it up, I should navigate to the specific table (table_38) in the living room where the pen is located.

Result: Unexpected failure! - No valid placements found for entity floor_bedroom_1. It looks like the spatial constraint next_to is not feasible because the reference object bed_49 either does not exist or has not yet been placed on the floor_bedroom_1. Try placing the grasped object pen_0 on floor_bedroom_1 without the spatial constraint next_to.
