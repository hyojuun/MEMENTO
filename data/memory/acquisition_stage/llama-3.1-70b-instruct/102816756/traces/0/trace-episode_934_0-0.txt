Task: Put the candle holder, statue, and vase back on the table in the bedroom. I prefer to have the candle holder, statue, and vase arranged on the bedroom table for a calming atmosphere.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the bedroom to locate the candle holder, statue, and vase.

Thought: Since the initial exploration of the bedroom did not find any objects, I should explore the bedroom again to see if I missed any objects or if they are on a different piece of furniture.

Thought: Since the second exploration of the bedroom still did not find any objects, I should explore other rooms in the house to see if the candle holder, statue, and vase are located elsewhere.
