Task: First, move the kettle, then the teapot, and finally the cup from the kitchen counter to the dining room table. Place them next to each other. I like to arrange the kettle, teapot, and cup on the dining room table in this order for my afternoon tea ritual.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the kitchen to locate the kettle, teapot, and cup.
