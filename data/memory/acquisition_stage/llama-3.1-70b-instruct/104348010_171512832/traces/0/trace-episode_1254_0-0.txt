Task: Move the vase and statue from the bedroom table to the entryway chest of drawers. Place them next to each other on the chest of drawers. I like having the vase and statue together in the entryway for a welcoming aesthetic.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the bedroom to locate the vase and statue on the table.
