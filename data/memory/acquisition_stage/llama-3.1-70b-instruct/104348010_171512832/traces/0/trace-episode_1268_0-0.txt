Task: Swap the can and bottle to office table? The can is silver and contains Polar Herring Fillets, Smoked & Peppered, 7.05 oz., and the bottle is black and white with a leaf pattern. The can is part of my favorite food collection.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring a room where the can and bottle might be located. A common place for food and drinks is the kitchen or a similar room. I will explore the kitchen_1 to see if the can and bottle are there.

Thought: Although the exploration of the kitchen_1 took too long to finish, I was able to find some objects, including can_0 and bottle_1, which are the objects of interest. However, I also found other cans and bottles, so I need to identify which ones are the correct ones. I will use the DescribeObjectTool to get more information about can_0 and bottle_1.
