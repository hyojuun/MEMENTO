Task: Help me prepare the laundry room for a cleaning session. First, move the vase from the washer dryer to the closet table. Then, take the stuffed toy and basket and place them next to each other on the chest of drawers. I always set up the laundry room this way before starting a cleaning session.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the laundry room to locate the vase, stuffed toy, and basket.
