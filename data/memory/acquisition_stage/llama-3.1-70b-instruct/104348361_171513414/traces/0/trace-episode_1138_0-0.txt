Task: Move the clock to a new living room table. Also, move the candle holder to a new living room table. I prefer to have the clock and candle holder together on the new table for a cozy ambiance.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the living room to locate the clock and candle holder, as they are likely to be on a table or other furniture in that room.

Thought: I have found three tables in the living room: table_18, table_22, and table_23. Since I already picked up the clock from table_22, I will choose table_18 as the new table to place the clock. But first, I need to make sure I am close to table_18.
