Task: Help me organize my closet in the bedroom. First, place the basket and shoe on another shelf in the bedroom, next to each other. Then, move them to the stand in the bedroom and place the hat close by. I have a routine of organizing my closet by first rearranging items on the shelf before placing them on the stand with the hat nearby.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the bedroom to locate the basket, shoe, and hat, as they are likely to be in the bedroom.

Thought: I have found the basket and shoe on shelves_14 in bedroom_1, and the hat on stand_23 in bedroom_2. Now, I need to pick up the basket from shelves_14 in bedroom_1.

Thought: I have successfully picked up the basket. Now, I need to place it on another shelf in bedroom_1, next to the shoe.

Assigned!<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>


Result: Unexpected failure! - No valid placements found for entity shelves_12. It looks like the spatial constraint next_to is not feasible because the reference object shoe_1 either does not exist or has not yet been placed on the shelves_12. Try placing the grasped object basket_0 on shelves_12 without the spatial constraint next_to.

Thought: Since the spatial constraint next_to is not feasible, I will place the basket on shelves_12 without the constraint. Then, I will pick up the shoe and place it next to the basket.
