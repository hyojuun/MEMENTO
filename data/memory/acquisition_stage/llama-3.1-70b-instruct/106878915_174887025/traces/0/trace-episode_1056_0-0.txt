Task: Put the phone stand, laptop stand, and multiport hub on the table in the bedroom. I prefer to have my phone stand, laptop stand, and multiport hub in the bedroom for a tidy and organized workspace.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring a room that might contain the phone stand, laptop stand, and multiport hub. The living room (living_room_1) is a common place for these objects, so I will explore it first.

Thought: Since the living room (living_room_1) did not contain the phone stand, laptop stand, and multiport hub, I should explore the bedroom (bedroom_1) next, as it is a common place where these objects might be found.
