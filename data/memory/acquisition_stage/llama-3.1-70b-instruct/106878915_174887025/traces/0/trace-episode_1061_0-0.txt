Task: Move the vase, candle, and book from the bedroom shelves to the living room table and place them next to each other. I like to have these items together on the living room table for a cozy and decorative look.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the bedroom to locate the vase, candle, and book on the shelves.
