Task: Move the plant container from the living room table to the bedroom shelves. I prefer having my plant container on the bedroom shelves to create a calming atmosphere.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the living room to locate the plant container, as it is likely to be on the table in that room.
