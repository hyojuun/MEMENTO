Task: Move the lamp and plant container from the bedroom table to the living room table. Place them next to each other on the table. I like having the lamp and plant container together on the living room table for a cozy evening ambiance.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the bedroom to locate the lamp and plant container.
