Task: Move the lamp to the bedroom table. Move the statue to the living room shelves. I prefer to have the lamp on the bedroom table for reading and the statue on the living room shelves for display.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the living room to locate the lamp and the statue.

Thought: I have found the lamp on the shelves in the living room, but I still need to find the statue. Since the statue is not in the living room, I will explore another room to try to find it. I will explore the bedroom_1.
