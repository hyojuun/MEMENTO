Task: Move the dumbbell and shoe to the shelves in the living room and place them next to each other. I prefer to keep my workout equipment like dumbbells and shoes together on the living room shelves for easy access during workouts.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring a room that might contain a dumbbell and a shoe. The living room (living_room_1) is a common place for various objects, so I will explore it first.

Thought: Since the living room (living_room_1) did not contain the dumbbell and shoe, I will explore another room that might contain these objects. The bedroom (bedroom_1) is a common place for personal items, so I will explore it next.
