Task: Help me set up some visuals on the shelves. Move the picture frame and lamp there. The book can stay where it is. I prefer to have the picture frame and lamp on the shelves to enhance the visual appeal of the room.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the living room to locate the picture frame and lamp, as they are likely to be in that room.

Thought: I have found the picture frame (picture_frame_0) on table_30 in hallway_1, but it is not in the living room. I also found a lamp (lamp_1) on the same table. I will navigate to the hallway to pick up the picture frame and lamp.
