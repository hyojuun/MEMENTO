Task: Move the lamp and then the vase from the table in the living room to the shelves, placing them next to each other. The lamp has a pineapple-shaped neon outline with a black base, and the vase is simple and gray. The lamp was a gift from my best friend.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the living room to locate the lamp with a pineapple-shaped neon outline and a black base, and the simple and gray vase.
