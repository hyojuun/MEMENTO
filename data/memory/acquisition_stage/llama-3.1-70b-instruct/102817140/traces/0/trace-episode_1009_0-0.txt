Task: Move the lamp to the bedroom table. Move the statue to the living room shelves. The lamp is wooden with a white spherical shade, and the statue is black hand-shaped with a glossy finish. The lamp was a gift from my grandmother.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring a room that might contain the lamp or the statue. The living room (living_room_1) is a common place for lamps and decorative items, so I will explore it first.
