Task: Move the laptop and then the laptop stand from the living room table to the bedroom table and place them next to each other. The laptop is black with a touchpad, and the laptop stand is black with foldable legs. The laptop is my personal device.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the living room to locate the laptop and laptop stand on the table.
