Task: First, move the phone stand and candle to the bedroom couch? Then, relocate them to the dining table and place them next to each other. Leave the doll on the living room couch. I like to move the phone stand and candle to the bedroom couch occasionally before finally placing them on the dining table next to each other for dining ambiance. The doll stays on the living room couch as part of the decor.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the living room to locate the phone stand and candle, as they are likely to be on a table or shelf in that room.

Thought: I have found the doll on the living room couch, but I still need to find the phone stand and candle. Since they are not in the living room, I will explore the bedroom to see if they are there.
