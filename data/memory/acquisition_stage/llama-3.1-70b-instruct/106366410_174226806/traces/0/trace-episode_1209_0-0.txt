Task: First, move the phone stand and candle to the bedroom couch. Then, relocate them to the dining table and place them next to each other. Leave the doll on the living room couch. The phone stand is black with a minimalist design, and the candle is mint green with white butterfly designs. The candle was a gift from my best friend.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring a room that might contain the phone stand and candle. The living room (living_room_1) is a common place for these objects, so I will explore it first.

Thought: I have found a doll on the living room couch, but I still need to find the phone stand and candle. Since the task mentions that the doll should be left on the living room couch, I will ignore it for now and explore another room that might contain the phone stand and candle. The bedroom (bedroom_1) is a possible location, so I will explore it next.

Thought: I have found multiple phone stands and candles in the bedroom, but I need to identify the correct ones based on their descriptions. The task mentions that the phone stand is black with a minimalist design, and the candle is mint green with white butterfly designs. I will use the DescribeObjectTool to get more information about these objects.
