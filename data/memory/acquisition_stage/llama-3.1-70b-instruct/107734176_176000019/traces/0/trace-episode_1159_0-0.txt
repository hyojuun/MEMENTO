Task: Put away the clock and vase by setting them on the washing machine. Set them next to each other. I prefer to keep the clock and vase together on the washing machine for easy access when I do laundry.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the laundry room to locate the clock and vase, as they need to be placed on the washing machine.

Thought: I have found a vase, but it's not in the laundry room. It's actually in the living room. I need to navigate to the living room to pick up the vase.

Thought: I am currently holding the vase and need to place it somewhere before I can pick up the clock. However, the task requires me to place the vase and clock next to each other on the washing machine. So, I will navigate to the laundry room first.
