Task: Move the vase and plate from the living room table to the lounge chair. I prefer to have the vase and plate on the lounge chair for easy access when I'm relaxing there.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the living room to locate the vase and plate on the living room table.
