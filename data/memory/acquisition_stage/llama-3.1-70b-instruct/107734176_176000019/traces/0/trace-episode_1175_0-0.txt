Task: Move the stuffed toy from the lounge chair to the porch chair. The stuffed toy is a brown and gray squirrel with a fluffy tail. This toy is a gift from my best friend.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the lounge_1 to locate the stuffed toy, which is a brown and gray squirrel with a fluffy tail.

Thought: I have found two stuffed toys on chair_19 in the lounge_1. I need to identify which one is the brown and gray squirrel with a fluffy tail. I will use the DescribeObjectTool to get more information about these stuffed toys.
