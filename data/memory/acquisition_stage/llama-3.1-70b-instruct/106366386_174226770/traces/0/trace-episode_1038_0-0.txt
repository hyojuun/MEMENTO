Task: Move the jug and cup from the kitchen to the bedroom. Place them next to each other on the chest of drawers. I like having the jug and cup together on the chest of drawers in the bedroom for a convenient night drink.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the kitchen to locate the jug and cup.
