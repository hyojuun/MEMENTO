Task: Put the shoe and pencil case on the bedroom chest of drawers. I prefer to keep my shoe and pencil case on the chest of drawers for quick access when I'm getting ready in the morning.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring a room to locate the shoe and pencil case. I will begin with the bedroom_1, as it is a common place for a chest of drawers to be located.

Thought: I have explored the bedroom_1, but I didn't find the shoe and pencil case. I will explore another room to locate these objects. I will try the closet_1, as it is a common place for shoes to be stored.
