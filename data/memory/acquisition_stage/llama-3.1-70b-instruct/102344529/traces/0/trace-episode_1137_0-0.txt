Task: First, move the candle from the table to the chair in the tv room. Then, place it on the tv table. The candle is mint green with white butterfly designs. This candle is my favorite.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the tv room to locate the mint green candle with white butterfly designs.
