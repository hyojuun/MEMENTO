Task: Move the candle and vase from the dining table to the tv couch. Place them next to each other on the couch. I like to keep the candle and vase together on the TV couch for a cozy atmosphere.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the dining room to locate the candle and vase on the dining table.
