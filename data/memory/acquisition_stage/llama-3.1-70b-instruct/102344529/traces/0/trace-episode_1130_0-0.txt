Task: Move the picture frame and vase from the dining room table to the TV shelves. Place them next to each other on the shelves. The picture frame is wooden with a black and white dove image, and the vase is brown and beige with a pebble-like pattern. The picture frame holds a special photo of my family's pet dove.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the dining room to locate the picture frame and vase on the table.

Thought: I have found multiple picture frames and vases in the dining room. I need to identify which picture frame is wooden with a black and white dove image and which vase is brown and beige with a pebble-like pattern. I will use the DescribeObjectTool to get more information about these objects.
