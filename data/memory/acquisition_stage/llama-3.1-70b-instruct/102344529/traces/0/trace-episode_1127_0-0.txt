Task: Move the phone stand to the tv table. Move the statue to the lounge counter. The phone stand is black with a minimalist design, and the statue is green of a sitting dog. The statue was a gift from my best friend.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring a room where the phone stand and statue might be located. A common place for a phone stand is a table or counter, and a statue could be on a shelf or table. I will explore the tv_1 room first, as it has multiple tables and chairs.
