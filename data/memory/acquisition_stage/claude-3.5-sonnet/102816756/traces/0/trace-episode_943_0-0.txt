Task: Put the plate and bowl together in another cabinet in the kitchen and place them next to each other. I prefer to keep my plates and bowls next to each other in the cabinet for easy access when setting the table.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, and we need to find a plate and a bowl in the kitchen, I should start by exploring the kitchen to locate these items.
