Task: First, move the lamp from the table in the bedroom to the counter in the kitchen. Next, move the jug to the counter in the kitchen and place it next to the lamp. I prefer to have the lamp and jug together on the kitchen counter for late-night snacks.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the bedroom to locate the lamp on the table.
