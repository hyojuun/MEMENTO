Task: First, move the toy vehicle from the bedroom to the living room. Then, place it on the couch in the living room. I often keep the toy vehicle on the living room couch so it's easy to find when I want to play with it.
Thought: Since we need to move a toy vehicle from the bedroom to the living room, we should first explore the bedroom to find the toy vehicle. There are multiple bedrooms, so let's start with bedroom_1.
