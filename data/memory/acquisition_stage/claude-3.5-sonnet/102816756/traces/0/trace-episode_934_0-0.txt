Task: Put the candle holder, statue, and vase back on the table in the bedroom. I prefer to have the candle holder, statue, and vase arranged on the bedroom table for a calming atmosphere.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the bedroom to locate the candle holder, statue, and vase. The task mentions that these items should be placed on the bedroom table, so bedroom_1 is the most logical place to start our search.

Thought: The exploration of bedroom_1 did not reveal the candle holder, statue, or vase. Since these decorative items could be in other rooms of the house, I should continue exploring other rooms. The living room is often a place where decorative items are kept, so I'll explore that next.
