Task: First, move the clock and then the picture frame from the living room shelves to the bedroom table. Then place them next to each other on the table. The clock is round and white with black numbers and a brown frame. The picture frame is ornate with a gold and blue design. The clock was a gift from my grandmother.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the living room to locate the clock and picture frame on the shelves.

Thought: I have successfully explored the living room and found multiple clocks and picture frames on shelves_41.
