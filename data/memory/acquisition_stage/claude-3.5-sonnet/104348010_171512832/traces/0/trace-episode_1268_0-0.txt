Task: Swap the can and bottle to office table? The can is silver and contains Polar Herring Fillets, Smoked & Peppered, 7.05 oz., and the bottle is black and white with a leaf pattern. The can is part of my favorite food collection.
Thought: Since we haven't found any objects yet, and we need to locate a specific can and bottle, we should start by exploring the office, as that's where we need to move the items to.

Thought: The exploration of the office did not reveal the can or bottle we're looking for. Since the task mentions swapping items, they might be located in another room. Let's explore the kitchen, as it's a common place for food items like cans and bottles.
