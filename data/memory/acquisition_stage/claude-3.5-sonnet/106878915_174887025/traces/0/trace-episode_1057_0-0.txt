Task: Move the plate from the dining table to the bedroom shelves. Place it next to the bed. I usually keep a plate next to the bed for late-night snacks.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet and we need to move a plate from the dining table, I should start by exploring the living room, which likely contains the dining table.
