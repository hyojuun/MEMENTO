Task: Put the phone stand, laptop stand, and multiport hub on the table in the bedroom. I prefer to have my phone stand, laptop stand, and multiport hub in the bedroom for a tidy and organized workspace.
Thought: Since we haven't found any objects yet, we should start by exploring the bedroom, as that's where we need to place the items. We'll start with bedroom_1.

Result: After looking at the scene I can tell that the furniture that match the query are:
- table_13 in bedroom

Note that the query specifically asks for a table in "bedroom_1", but the available information doesn't distinguish between different bedrooms. I've provided the table that is listed as being in a bedroom.

Thought: We've found a table (table_13) in the bedroom, but it's not specifically listed as being in bedroom_1. However, since it's the only table we've found in a bedroom, we'll use this one. Let's navigate to this table to place the phone stand.
