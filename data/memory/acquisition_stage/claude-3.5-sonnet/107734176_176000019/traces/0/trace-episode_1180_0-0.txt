Task: Move the stuffed toy and the bowl to the kitchen and leave them next to each other on the counter. The stuffed toy is a gray elephant with a soft, plush texture called Sootheze Cold Therapy Elephant, and the bowl is plain white. The elephant stuffed toy is from my childhood.

The stuffed toy, being from childhood, might be in a bedroom, while the bowl could be in various rooms. Let's start with exploring a bedroom.
