Task: Put away the clock and vase by setting them on the washing machine. Set them next to each other. I prefer to keep the clock and vase together on the washing machine for easy access when I do laundry.
Thought: Since we need to find a clock and a vase, and then place them on the washing machine, we should start by exploring the laundry room where the washing machine is likely to be located.
