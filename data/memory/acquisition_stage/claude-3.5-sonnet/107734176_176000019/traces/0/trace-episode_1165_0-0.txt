Task: Move the stuffed toy and the bowl to the kitchen and leave them next to each other on the counter. I always place the stuffed toy and bowl together on the kitchen counter as they are a part of my daily routine with my pet.
Thought: Since we haven't found any objects yet and we need to locate a stuffed toy and a bowl, we should start by exploring a room where these items are likely to be found. The living room is a common place for stuffed toys, so let's explore there first.
