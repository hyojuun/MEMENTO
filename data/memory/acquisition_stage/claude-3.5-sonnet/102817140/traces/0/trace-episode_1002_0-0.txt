Task: Move the dumbbell and shoe to the shelves in the living room and place them next to each other. I prefer to keep my workout equipment like dumbbells and shoes together on the living room shelves for easy access during workouts.
Thought: Since we haven't found any objects yet and we need to locate a dumbbell and a shoe, we should start by exploring the living room. This is where we ultimately need to place these items, and it's possible they might already be there.
