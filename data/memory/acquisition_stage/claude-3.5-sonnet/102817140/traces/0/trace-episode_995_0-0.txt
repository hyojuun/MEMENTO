Task: Move the lamp, vase, and picture frame from the living room table to the bedroom table. Place them next to each other on the bedroom table. I like to have the lamp, vase, and picture frame together on the bedroom table to create a cozy atmosphere before bedtime.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the living room to locate the lamp, vase, and picture frame on the table.

Result: After looking at the scene I can tell that the furniture that match the query are:
- table_13 in bedroom
- table_22 in bedroom
- table_24 in bedroom
- table_25 in bedroom

Note: The query specifically asks for a table in "bedroom_1", but the given information doesn't specify which tables are in which numbered bedroom. I've listed all tables located in any bedroom.

Thought: Thank you for the information. Since table_22 is specifically listed in the furniture for bedroom_1, I will use that as the target table. Now, I'll place the lamp on table_22.
