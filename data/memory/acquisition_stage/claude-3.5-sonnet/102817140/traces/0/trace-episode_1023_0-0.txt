Task: Move the laptop and then the laptop stand from the living room table to the bedroom table and place them next to each other. The laptop is black with a touchpad, and the laptop stand is black with foldable legs. The laptop is my personal device.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the living room to locate the black laptop with a touchpad and the black laptop stand with foldable legs. The task mentions they are on the living room table.

Result: After looking at the scene I can tell that the furniture that match the query are:
- table_13 in bedroom
- table_22 in bedroom
- table_24 in bedroom
- table_25 in bedroom

Note: The query specifically asks for a table in "bedroom_1", but the available information doesn't distinguish between different bedrooms. I've listed all tables located in any bedroom.
