Task: Place the laptop stand on the living room table next to the laptop. I prefer to keep my laptop stand next to the laptop on the living room table for easy access during work sessions.
Thought: Since we need to place the laptop stand on the living room table next to the laptop, we should first explore the living room to locate these items.
