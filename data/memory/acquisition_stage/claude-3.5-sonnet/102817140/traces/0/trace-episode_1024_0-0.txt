Task: Move the dumbbell and shoe to the shelves in the living room and place them next to each other. The dumbbell is black and hexagonal with a metal handle, and the shoe is a black and pink running shoe, PureConnect 2. The shoe is part of my favorite running gear.
Thought: Since we haven't found any objects yet, and we need to locate a dumbbell and a shoe, we should start by exploring the living room. This is because the task mentions placing the items on shelves in the living room, so it's a good place to begin our search.

Thought: The exploration of the living room didn't reveal the dumbbell or shoe we're looking for. However, we now have information about some objects in bedroom_2. Since we need to find a specific dumbbell (black and hexagonal with a metal handle) and a specific shoe (black and pink running shoe, PureConnect 2), we should explore bedroom_2 to see if these items are there.
