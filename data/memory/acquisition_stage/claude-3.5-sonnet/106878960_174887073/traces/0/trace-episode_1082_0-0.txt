Task: Move the vase and stuffed toy from the dining table to the office shelves. Place them next to each other on the shelves. I prefer to keep the vase and stuffed toy together on the office shelves for a personal touch in my workspace.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the dining room to locate the vase and stuffed toy on the dining table.
