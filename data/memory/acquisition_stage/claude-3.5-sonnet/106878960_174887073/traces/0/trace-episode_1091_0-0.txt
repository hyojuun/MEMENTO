Task: Move the plate and bowl from the dining table to the living room table. Place them next to each other. I like to have the plate and bowl together on the living room table for casual meals while watching TV.
Thought: Since we need to move the plate and bowl from the dining table to the living room table, we should start by exploring the dining room to locate these objects.
