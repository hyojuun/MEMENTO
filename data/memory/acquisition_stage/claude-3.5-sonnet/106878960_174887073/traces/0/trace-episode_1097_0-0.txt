Task: Move the vase and stuffed toy from the dining table to the office shelves. Place them next to each other on the shelves. The vase is brown with a ribbed design, and the stuffed toy is blue with a textured pattern and a white snout. The stuffed toy is my favorite childhood toy.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, and the task mentions moving items from the dining table, I should start by exploring the dining room to locate the vase and stuffed toy.

Thought: I have successfully explored the dining room and found multiple vases and stuffed toys on table_11.
