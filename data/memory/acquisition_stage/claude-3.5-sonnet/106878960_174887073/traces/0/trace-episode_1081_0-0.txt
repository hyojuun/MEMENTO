Task: Take the basket, can, and plant container from the kitchen cabinet to the dining table. I typically set them on the dining table for easy access when I'm organizing a centerpiece.
Thought: Since we need to find a basket, can, and plant container in the kitchen cabinet, we should start by exploring the kitchen to locate these items.

Result: After looking at the scene I can tell that the furniture that match the query are:
- table_11 in dining_room

While this table is not explicitly labeled as a "dining table", it is the only table present in the dining room, so it is most likely to be the dining table.
