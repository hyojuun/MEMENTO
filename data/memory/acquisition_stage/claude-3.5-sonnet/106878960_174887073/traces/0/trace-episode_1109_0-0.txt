Task: First, move the plate from the dining table to the chair. Then, place it on the table in the office. The plate is golden with a scalloped edge. It's a special gift from my grandmother.
Thought: Since we need to move a plate from the dining table, we should start by exploring the dining room to locate the golden plate with a scalloped edge.

Result: After looking at the scene I can tell that the furniture that match the query are:
No chair was found in the dining room. I was able to find following chairs though:

Objects: plate_0: held by the agent
plate_2: table_11 in dining_room_1
Thought: I apologize for the confusion. It seems there is no chair in the dining room. Since the task requires us to move the plate to a chair first, we should choose the nearest chair to the dining room. The living room chairs (chair_13 or chair_14) are likely the closest. Let's navigate to chair_13 in the living room.
