Task: Move the toy airplane and toy vehicle from the closet shelves to the living room table. Place them next to each other on the table. I like to have the toy airplane and toy vehicle displayed together on the living room table for easy access when playing with them.
Thought: Since we need to find the toy airplane and toy vehicle, and they are mentioned to be on closet shelves, we should start by exploring the closet. There are two closets in the house description, so let's start with closet_1.

Thought: Great, we've found both the toy_vehicle_1 and toy_airplane_0 on shelves_24 in closet_1. Now, we need to pick up one of these toys to move it to the living room table. Let's start with the toy airplane.

Thought: Now that we have successfully picked up the toy airplane, we need to move it to the living room table. The living room is identified as living_room_1, and there are two tables mentioned: table_14 and table_15. Let's navigate to the living room first.
