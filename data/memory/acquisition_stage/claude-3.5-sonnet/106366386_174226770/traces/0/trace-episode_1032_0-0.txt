Task: Put the shoe and pencil case on the bedroom chest of drawers. I prefer to keep my shoe and pencil case on the chest of drawers for quick access when I'm getting ready in the morning.
Thought: Since we need to put a shoe and a pencil case on the bedroom chest of drawers, we should start by exploring the bedroom to find these items or the chest of drawers.

Thought: We've explored the bedroom, but we haven't found the shoe or pencil case yet. However, we did find the chest of drawers (chest_of_drawers_36, chest_of_drawers_37, chest_of_drawers_38) in the bedroom. Since these items are not in the bedroom, we should explore other rooms where they might be stored, such as the closet or living room.
