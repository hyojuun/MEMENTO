Task: Move the candle holder, candle, and plant container from the dining table to the living room couch. Place them next to each other on the couch. In the evening, I like having these items together on the couch for a cozy atmosphere.
Thought: Since we need to move items from the dining table to the living room couch, we should first explore the dining room to locate the candle holder, candle, and plant container.
