Task: Move the phone stand, laptop stand, and multiport hub to the entryway and place them on the table. I prefer to have these items ready on the entryway table for when I head out for work.
Thought: Since we haven't found any objects yet, we should start by exploring the living room, as it's a common place for electronic accessories like phone stands and laptop stands.
