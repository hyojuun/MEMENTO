Task: Organize the bedroom. Put the vase, book, and clock on the chest of drawers. I prefer to have the vase, book, and clock neatly arranged on the chest of drawers for a tidy look.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet and we need to organize the bedroom, I should start by exploring the bedroom to locate the vase, book, and clock.

Thought: I've explored bedroom_1 and found a glass on the chest_of_drawers_32, but I haven't found the vase, book, or clock in this room. The book_1 is located in bedroom_2. I should explore bedroom_2 to see if I can find the other objects we need.

The vase (vase_0) and clock (clock_2) are on table_26 in bedroom_2, and the book (book_1) is on shelves_16 in bedroom_2. We need to move these to the chest_of_drawers_32 in bedroom_1.
