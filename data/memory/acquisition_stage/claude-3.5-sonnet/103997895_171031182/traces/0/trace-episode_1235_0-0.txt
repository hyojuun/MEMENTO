Task: Move the android figure to a new living room table. Also, move the action figure to a new living room table. The android figure is a black and white Android_Figure_Panda, and the action figure is a green and blue Leonardo from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. The Android figure is a collectible item.
Thought: Since we haven't found any objects yet and we need to locate both the Android figure and the action figure, we should start by exploring the living room, as that's where we need to move these figures to.

Thought: We have successfully explored the living room and found several objects, including two android figures on table_14 and two action figures on table_19. We need to identify which android figure is the black and white Android_Figure_Panda and which action figure is the green and blue Leonardo from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Let's start by describing the android figures.

Thought: We have successfully identified both figures we need to move: android_figure_0 (the black and white Android_Figure_Panda) and action_figure_1 (the green and blue Leonardo from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles). Now, we need to move them to new tables in the living room. Let's start by picking up android_figure_0.

Both figures are now on new tables as requested. The task is complete, so we can indicate that we are done.
