Task: First, move the candle and then the vase from the living room shelves to the bathroom toilet. Place them next to each other on the toilet. The candle is tall and cylindrical with a lavender color, and the vase is dark blue with a faceted design. The candle is my favorite for relaxation.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, and the task mentions that the candle and vase are on the living room shelves, I should start by exploring the living room to locate these items.
