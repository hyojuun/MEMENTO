Task: Move the statue and picture frame from the table in the living room to the shelves in the bedroom. Place them next to each other on the shelves. The statue is beige on a black base, and the picture frame is silver with an ornate border. The statue is a keepsake from my travels.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the living room to locate the statue and picture frame on the table.

Thought: I have successfully explored the living room and found multiple picture frames and statues on table_19. Now, I need to identify which statue and picture frame match the descriptions given in the task. I'll use the DescribeObjectTool to get more information about these objects.

Thought: The description of picture_frame_1 matches the one given in the task (silver with an ornate border). Now that I have identified both the correct statue (statue_0) and picture frame (picture_frame_1), I'll start by picking up the statue.

Thought: I have successfully navigated to bedroom_2. Now, I need to place the statue on the shelves. I'll use the FindReceptacleTool to identify the exact name of the shelves in the bedroom.

FindReceptacleTool[shelves in bedroom_2]
Assigned!
Result: After looking at the scene I can tell that the furniture that match the query are:
- shelves_16 in bedroom

While there is a shelves unit in the bedroom, I don't have specific information about which bedroom (bedroom_1 or bedroom_2) it is located in. The query asks about bedroom_2 specifically, but the available data doesn't distinguish between different bedrooms at that level of detail.
Objects: picture_frame_3: table_19 in living_room_1
statue_0: held by the agent
picture_frame_1: table_19 in living_room_1
statue_4: table_19 in living_room_1
cup_2: couch_17 in living_room_1
Thought: The FindReceptacleTool has identified shelves_16 in the bedroom, but it's not clear which specific bedroom it's in. Since I'm already in bedroom_2, I'll assume that shelves_16 is in this room and attempt to place the statue on it.
