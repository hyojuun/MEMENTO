Task: Move the laptop and the mouse pad to a new living room table. Move the clock to another shelf. I prefer to have my laptop and mouse pad on the living room table for work, and the clock on a different shelf to keep track of time without cluttering my workspace.
Thought: Since we haven't found any objects yet, we should start by exploring the living room to locate the laptop and mouse pad.

There are two tables present in the living room, so either of these could be considered "another table" depending on which one is being referenced initially.
