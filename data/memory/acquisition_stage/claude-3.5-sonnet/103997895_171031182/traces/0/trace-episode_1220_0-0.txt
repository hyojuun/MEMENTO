Task: Move the jug, cup, and plate to the living room table. I always like to have the jug, cup, and plate ready on the living room table for my afternoon tea time.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, and we need to find a jug, cup, and plate, I should start by exploring the kitchen, as it's the most likely place to find these items.

Thought: Now that we're in the living room, we need to identify the correct table to place the jug on. There are two tables mentioned in the living room (table_14 and table_19). Let's use the FindReceptacleTool to find the most suitable table for our afternoon tea setup.

Result: After looking at the scene I can tell that the furniture that match the query are:
- table_14 in living_room
- table_19 in living_room

These tables are located in the living room and could potentially be used for afternoon tea. However, I don't have specific information about their suitability for tea or any objects on them. If you need more details about objects on the tables, please use the FindObjectTool to query such information.

Thought: Since both tables are suitable for afternoon tea, let's choose table_14 for our setup. Now, we need to navigate to table_14 to place the jug.
