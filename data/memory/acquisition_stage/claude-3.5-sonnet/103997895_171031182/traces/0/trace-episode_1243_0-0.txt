Task: Move the picture frame and clock to the table in the bedroom. Then, place them next to each other on the counter in the kitchen. The picture frame is black with teardrop-shaped embellishments, and the clock is a dark green analog alarm clock with twin bells. The clock was a gift from my grandfather.
Thought: Since we need to find a picture frame and a clock, we should start by exploring the living room, as it's a common place for decorative items like these.
