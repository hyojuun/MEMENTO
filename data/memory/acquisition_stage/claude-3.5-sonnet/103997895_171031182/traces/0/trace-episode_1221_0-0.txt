Task: Take the book, pencil case, and multiport hub from the table in the living room and put them on the shelves in the bedroom, placing them next to each other. I like to keep my study materials together on the bedroom shelves for easy access when I'm working or studying in my room.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the living room to locate the book, pencil case, and multiport hub on the table.
