Task: Move the phone stand to a new dining room chair. Also, move the statue to a new dining room chair. The phone stand is silver and light blue with a sleek design, and the statue is dark bronze with elongated features. The statue was a gift from my best friend.
Thought: Since we haven't found any objects yet, and the task involves moving items from the dining room, we should start by exploring the dining room to locate the phone stand and statue.
