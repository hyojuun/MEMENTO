Task: Move the toy airplane and toy vehicle from the tv table to the garage bench. Place them next to each other on the bench. I like to keep the toy airplane and toy vehicle together on the garage bench for easy access when playing with them.
Thought: Since we need to move objects from the tv table, we should start by exploring the tv room to locate the toy airplane and toy vehicle.
