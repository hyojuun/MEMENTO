Task: Move the picture frame and vase from the dining room table to the TV shelves. Place them next to each other on the shelves. The picture frame is wooden with a black and white dove image, and the vase is brown and beige with a pebble-like pattern. The picture frame holds a special photo of my family's pet dove.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, and the task mentions that the picture frame and vase are on the dining room table, I should start by exploring the dining room to locate these objects.

Thought: I have successfully explored the dining room and found two vases and two picture frames on table_26.
