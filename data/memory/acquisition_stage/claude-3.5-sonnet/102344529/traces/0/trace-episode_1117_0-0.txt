Task: Move the candle and vase from the dining table to the tv couch. Place them next to each other on the couch. I like to keep the candle and vase together on the TV couch for a cozy atmosphere.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the dining room to locate the candle and vase on the dining table.

Thought: I have successfully navigated to tv_1. Now, I need to place the candle on the couch in this room. I'll use the FindReceptacleTool to find the exact name of the couch in tv_1.

Result: After looking at the scene I can tell that the furniture that match the query are:
- couch_15 in tv
- couch_30 in tv

While there are two couches in the tv area, I don't have specific information about which one is in "tv_1". The query asks for a couch in "tv_1", but the furniture list only specifies "tv" without numbering. Both couches listed are in the tv area,
Objects: vase_1: table_26 in dining_room_1
candle_0: held by the agent
cup_3: couch_30 in tv_2
plate_2: couch_30 in tv_2
Thought: Thank you for the clarification. Since there are two couches in the TV area, and couch_30 is specifically mentioned to be in tv_2, I can deduce that couch_15 is likely the one in tv_1. I'll proceed to place the candle on couch_15.
