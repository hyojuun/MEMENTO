Task: Move the phone stand to the TV table and the statue to the lounge counter. I prefer to keep the phone stand on the TV table and the statue on the lounge counter for better aesthetics and accessibility.
Thought: Since we haven't found any objects yet, we should start by exploring the TV room to locate the phone stand, as it's mentioned that we need to move it to the TV table.

Thought: Now that we're back in the TV room (tv_1), we need to place the phone stand on the TV table. We should use the FindReceptacleTool to identify the correct table for placing the phone stand.

Thought: Based on the FindReceptacleTool result, we have multiple tables in the TV rooms. Since table_14 is in tv_1 and already has the statue on it, it's likely the main TV table. We should place the phone stand on this table.
