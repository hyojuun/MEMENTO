Task: First, put a clock next to the vase. Then, move both to the couch in the tv room. The vase is glossy black with a narrow neck, and the clock is gray with a rounded top and black numerals. The vase is a cherished family heirloom.
Thought: Since we haven't found any objects yet, and we need to locate a clock and a vase, we should start by exploring the living room, as it's a common place for decorative items like vases and clocks.
