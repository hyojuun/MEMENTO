Task: Move a book and a pencil case from the bedroom to the living room. Place them on the table. I usually keep my book and pencil case in the living room for my afternoon study sessions.
Thought: Since we need to move a book and a pencil case from the bedroom to the living room, we should start by exploring the bedroom to locate these items. There are multiple bedrooms in the house, so I'll start with bedroom_1.

Thought: I've explored bedroom_1, but I didn't find a book or a pencil case there. I should explore another bedroom to try to locate these items. Let's try bedroom_4, as it seems to have more furniture where these items might be placed.
