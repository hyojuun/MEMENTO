Task: First, move the shoe and then the hat from the bedroom to the office and set them on the floor. Then, place them next to each other on the office table. I usually like to have my shoes and hat organized together on the office table for easy access when I leave.
Thought: Since we need to move a shoe and a hat from the bedroom to the office, we should start by exploring the bedroom to find these items. There are multiple bedrooms in the house, so let's start with bedroom_1.
