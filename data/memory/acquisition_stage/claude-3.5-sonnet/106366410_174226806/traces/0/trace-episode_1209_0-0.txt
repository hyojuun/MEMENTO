Task: First, move the phone stand and candle to the bedroom couch. Then, relocate them to the dining table and place them next to each other. Leave the doll on the living room couch. The phone stand is black with a minimalist design, and the candle is mint green with white butterfly designs. The candle was a gift from my best friend.
Thought: Since we haven't found any objects yet, we should start by exploring the living room, as it's a common place for decorative items like phone stands and candles.
