Task: Move the dumbbell, tennis racquet, and spray bottle from the workout table to the office table. I like to keep these items on the office table when I'm not working out to keep the workout area clear.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the workout room to locate the dumbbell, tennis racquet, and spray bottle on the workout table.
