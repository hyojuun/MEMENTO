Task: First, move the phone stand and candle to the bedroom couch. Then, relocate them to the dining table and place them next to each other. Leave the doll on the living room couch. The phone stand is black with a minimalist design, and the candle is mint green with white butterfly designs. The candle was a gift from my best friend.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore a room I have not explored yet. The living room (living_room_1) seems like a good place to start as it is a common area where phone stands and candles might be found.
