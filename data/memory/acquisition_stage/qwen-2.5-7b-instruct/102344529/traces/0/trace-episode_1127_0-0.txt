Task: Move the phone stand to the tv table. Move the statue to the lounge counter. The phone stand is black with a minimalist design, and the statue is green of a sitting dog. The statue was a gift from my best friend.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the rec/game room to locate the black phone stand and the green sitting dog statue.

Thought: Since the rec/game room is not present in the graph, I should explore the tv room instead, as it is a common place to find a phone stand and a statue.
