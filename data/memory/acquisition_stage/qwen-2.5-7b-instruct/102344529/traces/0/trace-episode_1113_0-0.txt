Task: Move a laptop and a laptop stand from the lounge counter to the dining room table. Place them next to each other on the table. I prefer having my laptop and stand on the dining room table for working in a comfortable setting.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the lounge_1 to locate the laptop and laptop stand on the counter.
