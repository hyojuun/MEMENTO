Task: Move the toy airplane and toy vehicle from the TV table to the garage bench. Place them next to each other on the bench. The toy airplane is red and white with a pilot, and the toy vehicle is a blue toy train with a smiling face, Thomas & Friends Wooden Railway Talking Thomas. Both toys are part of my cherished collection.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the TV room to locate the toy airplane and toy vehicle on the table.

Thought: I have found multiple toy airplanes and toy vehicles on table_14 in the TV room. I need to identify the correct toy airplane and toy vehicle. The toy airplane is red and white with a pilot, and the toy vehicle is a blue toy train with a smiling face, Thomas & Friends Wooden Railway Talking Thomas. I will use the DescribeObjectTool to determine which objects match these descriptions.
