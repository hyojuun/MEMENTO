Task: Take the clock, vase, and candle from the table in the dining room and put them on the shelves in the TV room, placing them next to each other. I prefer to keep the clock, vase, and candle together on the shelves in the TV room to create a cozy atmosphere.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the dining room to locate the clock, vase, and candle on the table.
