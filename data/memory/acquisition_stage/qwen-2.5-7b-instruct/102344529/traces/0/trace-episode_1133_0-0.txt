Task: Help me prepare a snack in the tv room. First, move the apple, knife, and plate from the dining room to the tv room table. Place them next to each other on the table. The apple is red with a hint of orange, the knife is silver with a black handle, and the plate is dark blue and hexagonal. I prefer to use this knife and plate when preparing snacks.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the dining room to locate the apple, knife, and plate.
