Task: Move the toy airplane and toy vehicle from the tv table to the garage bench. Place them next to each other on the bench. I like to keep the toy airplane and toy vehicle together on the garage bench for easy access when playing with them.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the tv room to locate the toy airplane and toy vehicle on the table.

Thought: The previous attempt to place the toy vehicle next to the toy airplane failed because the `Place` action requires a specific furniture or floor as the target. Since the `bench_21` is already occupied by the toy airplane, I need to place the toy vehicle on the bench next to the toy airplane.
