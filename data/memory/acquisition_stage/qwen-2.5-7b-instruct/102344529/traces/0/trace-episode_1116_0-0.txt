Task: Move the picture frame and vase from the dining room table to the tv shelves. Place them next to each other on the shelves. I like to keep the picture frame and vase together on the tv shelves for a cohesive look.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the dining room to locate the picture frame and vase on the table.

Result: Incorrect syntax for place/rearrange skill. Spatial_constraint was valid, but corresponding reference_object was none. Ensure that the spatial constraint is required for rearranging this object, else try without it. Alternatively, the reference_object entity might be erroneous..
