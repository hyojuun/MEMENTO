Task: Put the candle holder, statue, and vase back on the table in the bedroom. I prefer to have the candle holder, statue, and vase arranged on the bedroom table for a calming atmosphere.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the bedroom_1 to locate the candle holder, statue, and vase.

Thought: The exploration of bedroom_1 did not yield any candle holder, statue, or vase. I will explore the living room_1 next, as it is another common place where such items might be found.
