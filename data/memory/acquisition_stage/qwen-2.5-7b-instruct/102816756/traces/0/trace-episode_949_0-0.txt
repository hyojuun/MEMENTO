Task: Put the candle holder, statue, and vase back on the table in the bedroom. The candle holder is white and tan with a rounded base, the statue is beige on a black base, and the vase is white with a rounded body and narrow neck. The vase was a gift from my best friend.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the bedroom_1 to locate the candle holder, statue, and vase.
