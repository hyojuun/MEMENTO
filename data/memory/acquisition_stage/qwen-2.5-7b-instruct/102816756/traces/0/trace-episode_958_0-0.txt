Task: Put the plate and bowl together in another cabinet in the kitchen and place them next to each other. The plate is a square white plate with a black geometric pattern, and the bowl is a white bowl with a brown lid. The plate and bowl are part of my dinnerware set.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the kitchen to locate the square white plate with a black geometric pattern and the white bowl with a brown lid.

Result: Incorrect syntax for place/rearrange skill. Spatial_constraint was valid, but corresponding reference_object was none. Ensure that the spatial constraint is required for rearranging this object, else try without it. Alternatively, the reference_object entity might be erroneous.. This may not be the correct node name, try using appropriate tool to get the exact name. If that doesnt work, this node may just not exist yet, explore the house to discover.
