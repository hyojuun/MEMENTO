Task: Move the laptop and phone stand to the table in the office. Place them next to each other on the table. The laptop is black with a touchpad, and the phone stand is black with a minimalist design. They are the essential part of my work setup.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore a room to locate the laptop and phone stand. The office (office_1) is the most likely place to find these items, so I will start there.

Thought: The office (office_1) did not contain any objects, so I should explore another room. The living room (living_room_1) is another likely place to find the laptop and phone stand, as it is a common area for such items.

Thought: The living room (living_room_1) did not contain the laptop and phone stand, but the objects found there (cup_2, cushion_3, laptop_6, laptop_0, phone_stand_1, phone_stand_5) are in the kitchen (kitchen_1). Therefore, I should explore the kitchen (kitchen_1) to locate the laptop and phone stand.
