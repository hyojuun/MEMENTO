Task: First, put a clock next to the vase. Then, move both to the couch in the tv room. The vase is glossy black with a narrow neck, and the clock is gray with a rounded top and black numerals. The vase is a cherished family heirloom.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the kitchen_1 to locate the glossy black vase and the gray clock.

Thought: The previous attempt to place the clock next to the vase on couch_45 resulted in an unexpected failure. This suggests that the placement might not be possible due to the current arrangement or the presence of other objects. I will navigate to the tv room and attempt to place the clock next to the vase there.

Thought: Now that the agent is in the tv room, I will attempt to place the clock next to the vase. I will use the couch_23 in the tv room as the reference furniture.

Result: Incorrect syntax for place/rearrange skill. reference_object was valid, but corresponding spatial_constraint was none. This may not be the correct node name, try using appropriate tool to get the exact name. If that doesnt work, this node may just not exist yet, explore the house to discover.

Thought: The previous attempt to place the clock next to the vase on couch_23 resulted in an incorrect syntax. I need to ensure that the spatial constraint and reference object are correctly specified. Since the reference object (vase_6) is already on the couch_23, I will use the correct spatial constraint "next_to".
