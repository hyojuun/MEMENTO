Task: First, move the shoe and then the hat from the bedroom to the office and set them on the floor. Then, place them next to each other on the office table. The shoe is a white and silver ASICS with royal blue accents, GEL-1140V model, and the hat is a beige straw with a black band, DPC Tropical Trends Hat. The shoe and the hat are part of my travel essentials.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the bedroom to locate the white and silver ASICS shoe with royal blue accents and the beige straw hat with a black band.

Thought: The `DescribeObjectTool` did not provide any useful information about the shoe or hat. Given that I have explored multiple rooms and still have not found the shoe or hat, I should re-examine the task and ensure that I have not missed any details or made any assumptions.

Since the shoe and hat have not been found in any of the rooms, I will try using the `FindObjectTool` to find the shoe and hat again, ensuring I provide the correct room name and specific locations.
