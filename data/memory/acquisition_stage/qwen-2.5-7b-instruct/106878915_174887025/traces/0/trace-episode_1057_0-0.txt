Task: Move the plate from the dining table to the bedroom shelves. Place it next to the bed. I usually keep a plate next to the bed for late-night snacks.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the dining room to locate the plate.

Thought: The node name for the dining room is likely incorrect or not yet present in the graph. I should use the `FindObjectTool` to find the exact name of the dining table where the plate might be located.
