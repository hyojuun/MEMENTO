Task: Move the candle holder, candle, and vase from the dining table to the living room shelves. Place them next to each other on the shelves. I prefer to have the candle holder, candle, and vase displayed together on the living room shelves for a cohesive look.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the dining room to locate the candle holder, candle, and vase on the dining table.

Thought: Since the dining room is not present in the graph, I should use the `FindObjectTool` to find the candle holder, candle, and vase. This tool will help me identify the exact names of these objects if they are present in the house.
