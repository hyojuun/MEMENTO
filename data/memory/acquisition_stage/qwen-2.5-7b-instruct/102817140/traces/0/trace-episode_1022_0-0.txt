Task: Move the statue and plant container from the living room shelves to the bedroom chest of drawers. Place them next to each other on the chest of drawers. The plant container is a colorful assortment of electric pots from Cole Hardware, and the statue is a gray dog-shaped statue. The dog statue is a souvenir from my last vacation.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the living room to locate the statue and plant container on the shelves.
