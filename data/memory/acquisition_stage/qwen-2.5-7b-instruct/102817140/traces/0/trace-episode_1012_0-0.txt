Task: Move the jug and cup from the kitchen counter to the living room table. Place them next to each other. The jug is red with a white dot pattern, and the cup is a white, 16 oz coffee mug, ACE Coffee Mug Kristen. The coffee mug is my favorite.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the kitchen to locate the red jug with a white dot pattern and the white, 16 oz coffee mug, ACE Coffee Mug Kristen.
