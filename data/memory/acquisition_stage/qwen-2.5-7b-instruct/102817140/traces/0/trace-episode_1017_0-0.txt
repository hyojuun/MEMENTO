Task: Move the lamp, vase, and picture frame from the living room table to the bedroom table. Place them next to each other on the bedroom table. The lamp is wooden with a white spherical shade, the vase is white with a narrow neck, and the picture frame is copper with a diamond pattern. The lamp is a gift from my grandmother.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the living room to locate the wooden lamp with a white spherical shade, the white vase with a narrow neck, and the copper picture frame with a diamond pattern.
