Task: Move the lamp, vase, and picture frame from the living room table to the bedroom table. Place them next to each other on the bedroom table. I like to have the lamp, vase, and picture frame together on the bedroom table to create a cozy atmosphere before bedtime.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the living room to locate the lamp, vase, and picture frame on the table.
