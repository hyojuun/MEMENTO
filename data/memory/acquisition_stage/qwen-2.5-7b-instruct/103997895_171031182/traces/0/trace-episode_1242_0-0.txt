Task: First, move the candle and then the vase from the living room shelves to the bathroom toilet. Place them next to each other on the toilet. The candle is tall and cylindrical with a lavender color, and the vase is dark blue with a faceted design. The candle is my favorite for relaxation.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the living room to locate the tall cylindrical lavender candle and the dark blue faceted vase.

Thought: The previous attempt to place the candle next to the vase on the toilet failed because the agent is not holding the candle. I need to pick up the candle first before placing it next to the vase.

Thought: I have successfully picked up the tall cylindrical lavender candle (candle_0). Now, I need to place the candle next to the dark blue faceted vase (vase_1) on the toilet.

Thought: The previous attempt to place the candle next to the vase on the toilet failed because the toilet is not a valid receptacle for placing objects side by side. Instead, I should place the candle on the toilet and then move the vase next to it.
