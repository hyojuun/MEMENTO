Task: Place the vase on the shelves, the candle on the table. I prefer to have the vase on the shelves and the candle on the table to create a cozy atmosphere in the room.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore a room I have not explored yet to locate the vase and the candle.

Thought: The living room did not contain any objects, so I should explore another room. The next room to explore is the bedroom_1, as it is a common place to find vases and candles.
