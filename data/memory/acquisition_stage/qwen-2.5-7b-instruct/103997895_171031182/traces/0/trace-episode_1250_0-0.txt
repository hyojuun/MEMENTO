Task: Move the toy airplane from the bedroom to the living room table. Place it next to the couch. The toy airplane is red, part of the Air Hogs Wind Flyers Set. It's a gift from my childhood friend.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the bedroom_1 to locate the red toy airplane from the Air Hogs Wind Flyers Set.

Thought: The exploration of the bedroom_2 found two toy airplanes, toy_airplane_0 and toy_airplane_2. I need to identify which one is the red toy airplane from the Air Hogs Wind Flyers Set. I will use the DescribeObjectTool to get more information about these toy airplanes.

Thought: The placement action failed because the spatial relation "next_to" is not supported for the current task. Instead, I should place the toy airplane on the living_room_1 table, which is a valid spatial relation.
