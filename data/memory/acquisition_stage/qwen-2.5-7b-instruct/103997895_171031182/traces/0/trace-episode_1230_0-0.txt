Task: Move the toy airplane from the bedroom to the living room table. Place it next to the couch. I like to keep the toy airplane next to the couch so I can easily play with it while relaxing.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the bedroom to locate the toy airplane.

Thought: The placement action failed because the spatial relation "next_to" is not supported. I should place the toy airplane on the table next to the couch instead.
