Task: Move the picture frame and clock to the table in the bedroom. Then, place them next to each other on the counter in the kitchen. I usually like to start my day by having the picture frame and clock together in the kitchen.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the bedroom_1 to locate the picture frame and clock.

Thought: The exploration of the bedroom_1 did not yield any results. Since the objects were found in the living_room_1, I should navigate to the living_room_1 to pick up the picture frame and clock.
