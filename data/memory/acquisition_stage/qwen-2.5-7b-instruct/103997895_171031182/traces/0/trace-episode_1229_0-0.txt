Task: Move the statue and picture frame from the table in the living room to the shelves in the bedroom. Place them next to each other on the shelves. I prefer to keep the statue and picture frame on the shelves in the bedroom to maintain a cohesive decor.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the living room to locate the statue and picture frame on the table.

Thought: The error indicates that the placement command might need a different spatial relation since "on" is not appropriate for placing objects next to each other on the same surface. I will use "next_to" directly without specifying the surface.

Result: Wrong use of API for place or rearrange. Please use [<object_to_be_moved>, <spatial_relation>, <furniture/floor to be placed>, <spatial_constraint> (Optional - None otherwise), <reference_object> (Optional - None otherwise)]. This may not be the correct node name, try using appropriate tool to get the exact name. If that doesnt work, this node may just not exist yet, explore the house to discover.
