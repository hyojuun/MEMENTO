Task: Move the book and clock from the living room shelves to the bedroom chair. Place them next to each other on the chair. I prefer to have my book and clock together on the bedroom chair for easy access before bed.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the living room to locate the book and clock on the shelves.

Thought: The previous attempt to place the clock next to the book on chair_9 failed because the "on" spatial relation is not appropriate. I should use the "next_to" spatial relation instead.

Place[clock_1, next_to, book_0, next_to, None]
Assigned!<|im_end|><|im_start|>user

Result: Incorrect syntax for place/rearrange skill. Spatial_constraint was valid, but corresponding reference_object was none. Ensure that the spatial constraint is required for rearranging this object, else try without it. Alternatively, the reference_object entity might be erroneous.. Use the appropriate tool to get a valid name.

Thought: The previous attempt to place the clock next to the book on chair_9 failed because the reference object was not specified correctly. I should use the "next_to" spatial relation without a reference object since the book is already on the chair.

Thought: The previous attempts to place the clock next to the book on chair_9 failed because the "next_to" spatial relation might not be directly applicable in this context. Instead, I should place the clock on the chair next to the book.
