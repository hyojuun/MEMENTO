Task: Move the stuffed toy, basket, and picture frame from the bedroom shelves to the living room table. Place them next to each other on the table. The stuffed toy is cream-colored, resembling a dog with a long nose, the basket is a teal plastic Spritz Easter Basket, and the picture frame is black adorned with teardrop-shaped embellishments. The stuffed toy was a gift from my best friend.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the bedroom_1 to locate the cream-colored stuffed toy, teal plastic Spritz Easter Basket, and black picture frame with teardrop-shaped embellishments.

Thought: The previous attempts to place the picture frame on the table next to the stuffed toy have failed. This suggests that the table might not be the correct receptacle or the placement might need a different approach. I will ensure that the table is the correct receptacle and attempt to place the picture frame again.
