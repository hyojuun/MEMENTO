Task: First, move the clock and then the picture frame from the living room shelves to the bedroom table. Then place them next to each other on the table. The clock is round and white with black numbers and a brown frame. The picture frame is ornate with a gold and blue design. The clock was a gift from my grandmother.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the living room to locate the round white clock with black numbers and a brown frame, as well as the ornate picture frame with a gold and blue design.
