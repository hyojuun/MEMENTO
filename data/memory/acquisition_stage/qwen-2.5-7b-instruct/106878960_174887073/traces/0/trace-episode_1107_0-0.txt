Task: First, bring the jug from the kitchen to the dining room. Then, place it on the table. The jug is cream-colored with a curved handle. The jug is a gift from my grandmother.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the kitchen to locate the cream-colored jug with a curved handle.
