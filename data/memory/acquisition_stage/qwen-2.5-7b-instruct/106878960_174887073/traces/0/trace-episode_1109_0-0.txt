Task: First, move the plate from the dining table to the chair. Then, place it on the table in the office. The plate is golden with a scalloped edge. It's a special gift from my grandmother.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the dining room to locate the golden plate with a scalloped edge.
