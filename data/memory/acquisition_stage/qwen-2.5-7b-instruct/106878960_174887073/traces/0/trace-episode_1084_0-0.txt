Task: Help me tidy up the closet. Move the basket, hat, and candle to the top of different shelves. I prefer to have the basket, hat, and candle each on separate shelves for better organization and easy access.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the closet_1 to locate the basket, hat, and candle.
