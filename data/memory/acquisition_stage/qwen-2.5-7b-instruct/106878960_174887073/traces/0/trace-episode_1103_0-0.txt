Task: Move the vase and then the plant saucer from the living room table to the hallway couch and place them next to each other. The vase is tall, dark green with a narrow neck, and the plant saucer is a natural-colored, round Ecoforms design. The vase was a gift from my friend.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the living room to locate the tall, dark green vase and the natural-colored, round Ecoforms plant saucer.
