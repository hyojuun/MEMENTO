Task: Move the candle holder and vase from the living room table to the office cabinet. Place them next to each other on the cabinet. I prefer to keep the candle holder and vase together on the office cabinet for a calming atmosphere while I work.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the living room to locate the candle holder and vase on the table.

Thought: The previous attempts to place the vase next to the candle holder on the cabinet failed because the candle holder is already on the cabinet and does not need to be moved. Instead, I should ensure the vase is correctly placed next to the candle holder.
