Task: Move the stuffed toy and the bowl to the kitchen and leave them next to each other on the counter. The stuffed toy is a gray elephant with a soft, plush texture called Sootheze Cold Therapy Elephant, and the bowl is plain white. The elephant stuffed toy is from my childhood.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the kitchen_1 to locate the gray elephant stuffed toy and the plain white bowl.

Result: Incorrect syntax for place/rearrange skill. Spatial_constraint was valid, but corresponding reference_object was none. Ensure that the spatial constraint is required for rearranging this object, else try without it. Alternatively, the reference_object entity might be erroneous.. Use the appropriate tool to get a valid name.
