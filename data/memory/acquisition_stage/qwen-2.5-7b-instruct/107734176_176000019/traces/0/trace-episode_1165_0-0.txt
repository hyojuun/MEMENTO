Task: Move the stuffed toy and the bowl to the kitchen and leave them next to each other on the counter. I always place the stuffed toy and bowl together on the kitchen counter as they are a part of my daily routine with my pet.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the kitchen_1 to locate the stuffed toy and the bowl.
