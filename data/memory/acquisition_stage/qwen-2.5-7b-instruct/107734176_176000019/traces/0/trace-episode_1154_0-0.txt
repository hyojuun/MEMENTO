Task: Move the jug, kettle, and bread from the kitchen counter to the living room table. Place them next to each other. I like to have the jug, kettle, and bread on the living room table for my morning routine.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the kitchen to locate the jug, kettle, and bread on the counter.
