Task: Put away the clock and vase by setting them on the washing machine. Set them next to each other. I prefer to keep the clock and vase together on the washing machine for easy access when I do laundry.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore a room I have not explored yet to locate the clock and vase.
