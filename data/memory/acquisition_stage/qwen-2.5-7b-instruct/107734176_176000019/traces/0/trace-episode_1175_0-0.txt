Task: Move the stuffed toy from the lounge chair to the porch chair. The stuffed toy is a brown and gray squirrel with a fluffy tail. This toy is a gift from my best friend.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the lounge_1 to locate the brown and gray squirrel stuffed toy. The lounge_1 is a likely place to find such a toy, as it is a common area in the house where people might place such items.
