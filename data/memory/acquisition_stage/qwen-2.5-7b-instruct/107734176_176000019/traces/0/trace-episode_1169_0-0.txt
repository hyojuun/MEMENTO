Task: Move the vase and plate from the living room table to the lounge chair. The plate is brown and square, and the vase is red with a long neck and bulbous base. The red vase is a souvenir from my trip to Italy.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the living room to locate the brown square plate and the red vase with a long neck and bulbous base.
