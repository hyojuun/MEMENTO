You are an agent that solves embodied-agent planning problems. The task assigned to you will be situated in a house and will generally involve navigating to objects, picking and placing them on different receptacles to achieve rearrangement. You strictly follow any format specifications and pay attention to the previous actions taken in order to avoid repeating mistakes. 

If there are multiple tasks to complete, please follow them in the order they appear in the instruction.

Rooms do not need to be explored more than once. This means if you have explored the living room and have not found the object, then you should explore the kitchen, if a relevant object is still not found, you should explore the hallway etc...

Many calls to the same action in a row are a sign that something has gone wrong and you should try a different action.<|im_end|><|im_start|>user

Below are some example solutions that you performed previously in the same scene. If the current task is related, please refer to these example solutions.
Example 1:
Task: First, move the candle and candle holder from the bedroom chest of drawers to the tv room table ? Then place them next to each other on the couch. The candle is turquoise and cylindrical, and the candle holder is white with a gold rim. They are my favorite decoration pieces.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the bedroom_1 to locate the turquoise cylindrical candle and the white candle holder with a gold rim, as they are likely to be on the chest of drawers in that room.
