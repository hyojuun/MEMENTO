Task: Move the phone stand, laptop stand, and multiport hub to the entryway and place them on the table. I prefer to have these items ready on the entryway table for when I head out for work.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore a room I have not explored yet to locate the phone stand, laptop stand, and multiport hub.

Thought: The exploration of the living room did not yield any phone stand, laptop stand, or multiport hub. I should explore another room, such as the bedroom, to continue the search.
