Task: Move the stuffed toys and put them in the chest of drawers in the bedroom. I prefer to keep my stuffed toys in the bedroom chest of drawers for easy access and organization.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore a room I have not explored yet. The bedroom_1 seems like a good place to start as it contains a chest of drawers where the stuffed toys can be placed.

Thought: The exploration of bedroom_1 did not yield any stuffed toys, but it did find a stuffed toy on the table in the dining room. I should navigate to the dining room to pick up the stuffed toy and then move it to the bedroom_1.
