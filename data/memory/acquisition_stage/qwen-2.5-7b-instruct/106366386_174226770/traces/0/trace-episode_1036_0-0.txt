Task: Move the toy airplane and toy vehicle from the closet shelves to the living room table. Place them next to each other on the table. I like to have the toy airplane and toy vehicle displayed together on the living room table for easy access when playing with them.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the closet_1 to locate the toy airplane and toy vehicle on the shelves.
