Task: Move the candle holder, candle, and plant container from the dining table to the living room couch. Place them next to each other on the couch. In the evening, I like having these items together on the couch for a cozy atmosphere.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the dining room to locate the candle holder, candle, and plant container on the table.
