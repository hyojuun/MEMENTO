Task: Move the lamp to the bedroom table. Move the statue to the living room shelves. I prefer to have the lamp on the bedroom table for reading and the statue on the living room shelves for display.
Thought: To complete the tasks, I need to first locate the lamp and the statue. Since no objects have been found yet, I will start by exploring the living room, as it is a common place for both lamps and statues.
