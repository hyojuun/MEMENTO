Task: Swap the can and bottle to office table? The can is silver and contains Polar Herring Fillets, Smoked & Peppered, 7.05 oz., and the bottle is black and white with a leaf pattern. The can is part of my favorite food collection.
Thought: To begin the task of swapping the can and bottle to the office table, I need to locate the can and the bottle first. Since the can is part of a food collection, it is likely to be found in the kitchen. I will start by exploring the kitchen to find the can.
