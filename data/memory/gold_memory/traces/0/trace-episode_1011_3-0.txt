Task: Can we move the candle and vase from the living room table to the bedroom chest of drawers? The candle is white with a light blue base in a round holder, and the vase is black with white geometric patterns. The black vase was a special gift to me.
Thought: To begin the task, I need to locate the candle and the vase in the living room. I will start by exploring the living room to find these objects.
