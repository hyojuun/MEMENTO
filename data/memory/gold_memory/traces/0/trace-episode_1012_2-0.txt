Task: Move the jug and cup from the kitchen counter to the living room table. Place them next to each other. The jug is red with a white dot pattern, and the cup is a white, 16 oz coffee mug, ACE Coffee Mug Kristen. The coffee mug is my favorite.
Thought: The task requires moving a jug and a specific coffee mug from the kitchen counter to the living room table. Since I need to locate these objects first, I will start by exploring the kitchen to find the jug and the coffee mug.
