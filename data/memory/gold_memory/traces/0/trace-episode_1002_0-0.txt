Task: Move the dumbbell and shoe to the shelves in the living room and place them next to each other. I prefer to keep my workout equipment like dumbbells and shoes together on the living room shelves for easy access during workouts.
Thought: To begin the task, I need to locate the dumbbell and shoe. I will start by exploring the living room, as it is the target location for placing these objects, and it might already contain them.
