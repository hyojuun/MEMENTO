Task: First, move the clock from the table in the bedroom to the stand and place it next to the vase. Then, move the vase from the stand in the bedroom to the shelves in the living room. The clock is maroon and square with a patterned face, and the vase is black with a round shape. The clock was a gift from my grandfather.
Thought: The task requires moving the clock from the table in the bedroom to the stand and placing it next to the vase. Since the clock is located in the bedroom, I will start by exploring bedroom_2 to find the clock and the stand.
