Task: Move the laptop and phone stand to the table in the office. Place them next to each other on the table. The laptop is black with a touchpad, and the phone stand is black with a minimalist design. They are the essential part of my work setup.
Thought: To begin the task, I need to locate the laptop and phone stand. Since I have not explored any rooms yet, I will start by exploring the living room, as it is a common place for electronic devices to be found.
