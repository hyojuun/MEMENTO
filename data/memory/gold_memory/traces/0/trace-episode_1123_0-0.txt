Task: Move the phone stand to a new dining room chair. Also, move the statue to a new dining room chair. The phone stand is silver and light blue with a sleek design, and the statue is dark bronze with elongated features. The statue was a gift from my best friend.
Thought: To begin the task, I need to locate the phone stand and the statue. I will start by exploring the dining room, as it is the target location for placing the objects, and it might already contain the objects.
