Task: Take the basket, can, and plant container from the kitchen cabinet to the dining table? The basket is a teal plastic Spritz Easter Basket, the can is a brown and yellow coffee can, Don Francisco's Gourmet Coffee Medium Decaf, and the plant container is a white and green Cole Hardware Orchid Pot 85. The coffee can is my favorite brand.
Thought: To begin the task, I need to locate the basket, can, and plant container in the kitchen cabinet. I will start by exploring the kitchen to find these objects.
