Task: Move the candle holder, candle, and vase from the dining table to the living room shelves. Place them next to each other on the shelves. I prefer to have the candle holder, candle, and vase displayed together on the living room shelves for a cohesive look.
Thought: To begin the task, I need to locate the dining table where the candle holder, candle, and vase are placed. I will start by exploring the room that is most likely to contain the dining table.
