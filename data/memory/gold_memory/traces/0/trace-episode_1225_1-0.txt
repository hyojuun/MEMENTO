Task: Move the vase, then the lamp, and finally the plate to the table in the living room. Then, move them to the couch in the living room and place them next to each other. I prefer to keep the vase, lamp, and plate together on the couch in the living room after rearranging them from the table.
Thought: To begin the task, I need to locate the vase, lamp, and plate. Since no objects have been found yet, I will start by exploring the living room, as it is the target location for placing these objects initially.
