Task: Move the toy airplane and toy vehicle from the tv table to the garage bench. Place them next to each other on the bench. I like to keep the toy airplane and toy vehicle together on the garage bench for easy access when playing with them.
Thought: To begin the task, I need to locate the toy airplane and toy vehicle. Since they are currently on the tv table, I should explore the room where the tv table is located to find these objects. There are two rooms with "tv" in their names: tv_1 and tv_2. I will start by exploring tv_1.
