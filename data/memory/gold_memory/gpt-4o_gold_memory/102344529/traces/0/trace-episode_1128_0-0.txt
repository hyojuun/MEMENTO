Task: Move the tray to the cabinet in the toilet room and put the can on the counter in the lounge. The tray is white with cutout handles, and the can is a silver can of Polar Herring Fillets, Smoked & Peppered, 7.05 oz. The tray is a gift from my grandmother.
Thought: To begin the task, I need to locate the tray and the can. Since I have no information about their current locations, I will start by exploring the rooms. I will begin with the kitchen, as it is a common place to find cans.
