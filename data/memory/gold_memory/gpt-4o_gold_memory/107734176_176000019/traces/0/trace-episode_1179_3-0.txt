Task: Move the plant saucer and plant container from the table in the living room to the bench in the bathroom. Place them next to each other. The plant container is green, named Central Garden Flower Pot Goo 425, and the plant saucer is a green, square Ecoforms Quadra Saucer SQ1 Avocado. Both are part of my indoor gardening set.
Thought: The task requires moving two specific objects from the living room to the bathroom. First, I need to locate the plant saucer and plant container in the living room. I will start by exploring the living room to find these objects.
