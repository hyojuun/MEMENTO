Task: Move the jug and cup from the kitchen counter to the living room table. Then move the tray on the couch. I usually have the jug and cup on the living room table for serving drinks and the tray on the couch for easy access to snacks during movie nights.
Thought: To begin the task, I need to locate the jug and cup in the kitchen. I will start by exploring the kitchen to find these objects.
