Task: Help me move these objects from the workout room to the dining room. First, take the dumbbell from the table and place it on the dining table. Then, bring the tennis racquet from the chair and place it on another chair. Finally, take the basketball from the table and place it on the floor. I usually set up exercise equipment in the dining room to create an impromptu workout area.
Thought: To begin the task, I need to locate the dumbbell, tennis racquet, and basketball in the workout room. I will start by exploring the workout room to find these objects.
