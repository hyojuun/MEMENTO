Task: Move the candle from the living room stand to the office chair and place it next to the table. The candle is blue and black with a textured pattern. This candle was a gift from my friend.

Thought: The failure indicates that the table_36 might not be recognized as a valid reference object for placement. I should ensure that the table is correctly identified and present in the office. I will use the FindReceptacleTool to confirm the table's presence and identity in the office.

Thought: The table_36 is confirmed to be present in the office. The issue might be related to the placement logic. I will attempt to place the candle_0 on the chair_9 without specifying the spatial constraint to see if it resolves the issue.
