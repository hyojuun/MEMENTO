Task: Move the vase and then the plant saucer from the living room table to the hallway couch and place them next to each other. The vase is tall, dark green with a narrow neck, and the plant saucer is a natural-colored, round Ecoforms design. The vase was a gift from my friend.
Thought: The task requires moving a vase and a plant saucer from the living room table to the hallway couch. First, I need to locate these objects in the living room. I will start by exploring the living room to find the vase and the plant saucer.
