Task: Put the shoe and pencil case on the bedroom chest of drawers. I prefer to keep my shoe and pencil case on the chest of drawers for quick access when I'm getting ready in the morning.
Thought: To complete the task, I need to find the shoe and pencil case. I will start by exploring the entryway, as shoes are often found there.
