Task: Move the phone stand, laptop stand, and multiport hub to the entryway and place them on the table. I prefer to have these items ready on the entryway table for when I head out for work.
Thought: To begin the task, I need to locate the phone stand, laptop stand, and multiport hub. Since no objects have been found yet, I will start by exploring the living room, as it is a common place for such items.
