Task: Move the lamp to the bedroom table. Move the statue to the living room shelves. The lamp is wooden with a white spherical shade, and the statue is black hand-shaped with a glossy finish. The lamp was a gift from my grandmother.
Thought: To begin the task, I need to locate the lamp and the statue. I will start by exploring the living room, as it is a common place for both lamps and decorative items like statues.
