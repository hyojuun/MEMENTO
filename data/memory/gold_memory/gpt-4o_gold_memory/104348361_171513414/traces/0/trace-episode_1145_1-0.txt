Task: Move the clock to a new living room table. Also, move the candle holder to a new living room table. The clock is brown and black with a green display, and the candle holder is white with a gold rim on a wooden base. The candle holder is a gift from my friend.
Thought: To complete the task, I need to locate the clock and the candle holder in the house. Since the task involves moving these objects to a new living room table, I will start by exploring the living room to see if these objects are already there.

Thought: I have found multiple clocks and candle holders on table_22 in the living room. I need to identify the specific clock and candle holder described in the task. I will use the DescribeObjectTool to get more details about these objects.

Thought: The description of 'candle_holder_1' matches the candle holder described in the task. I have identified both the clock and the candle holder that need to be moved. Now, I need to find a new table in the living room to place these objects.

Result: No new table was found in living_room_1. I was able to find the following tables in the living room though:

clock_0: table_22 in living_room_1
candle_holder_1: table_22 in living_room_1
clock_3: table_22 in living_room_1
Thought: Since there is no explicitly labeled "new" table in the living room, I will choose a different table from the ones available, other than table_22, to place the clock and candle holder. I will use table_23 for this purpose. First, I will pick up the clock.
