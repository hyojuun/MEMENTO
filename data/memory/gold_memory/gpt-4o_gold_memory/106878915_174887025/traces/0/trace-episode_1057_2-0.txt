Task: Move the plate from the dining table to the bedroom shelves. Place it next to the bed. I usually keep a plate next to the bed for late-night snacks.
Thought: To complete the task, I need to first locate the plate on the dining table. Since the dining table is likely in the dining area, I should explore the kitchen first to find the plate.
