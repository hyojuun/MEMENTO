Task: Move the laptop and the mouse pad to a new living room table. Move the clock to another shelf. I prefer to have my laptop and mouse pad on the living room table for work, and the clock on a different shelf to keep track of time without cluttering my workspace.
Thought: To begin the task, I need to locate the laptop, mouse pad, and clock. Since no objects have been found yet, I will start by exploring the living room, as it is a common place for a laptop and mouse pad to be located.
