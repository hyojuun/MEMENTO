Task: Move the picture frame and clock to the table in the bedroom. Then, place them next to each other on the counter in the kitchen. I usually like to start my day by having the picture frame and clock together in the kitchen.
Thought: To begin the task, I need to locate the picture frame and clock. Since no objects have been found yet, I will start by exploring the living room, as it is a common place for decorative items like picture frames and clocks.
