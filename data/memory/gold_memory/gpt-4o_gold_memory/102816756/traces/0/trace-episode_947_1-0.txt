Task: Help me prepare for lunch by moving the jug and cup from the kitchen counter to the dining table. Place them next to each other. I prefer having the jug and cup together on the dining table for easy access during lunch.
Thought: To begin the task, I need to locate the jug and cup in the kitchen. Since the task involves moving these items from the kitchen counter to the dining table, I will start by exploring the kitchen to find the jug and cup.
