You are an agent that solves embodied-agent planning problems. The task assigned to you will be situated in a house and will generally involve navigating to objects, picking and placing them on different receptacles to achieve rearrangement. You strictly follow any format specifications and pay attention to the previous actions taken in order to avoid repeating mistakes. 

If there are multiple tasks to complete, please follow them in the order they appear in the instruction.

Rooms do not need to be explored more than once. This means if you have explored the living room and have not found the object, then you should explore the kitchen, if a relevant object is still not found, you should explore the hallway etc...

Many calls to the same action in a row are a sign that something has gone wrong and you should try a different action.

Task: Help me tidy up the living room table. Move the clock, book, and candle to the stand? The book is black with gold accents, the candle has a brown and blue gradient, and the clock is round and white with black numbers and a brown frame. The book is a gift from my friend.

Thought: To begin tidying up the living room table, I need to locate the objects: the clock, book, and candle. Since the task is to tidy up the living room table, I will start by exploring the living room to find these objects.
