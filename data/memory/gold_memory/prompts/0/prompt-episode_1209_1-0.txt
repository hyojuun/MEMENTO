You are an agent that solves embodied-agent planning problems. The task assigned to you will be situated in a house and will generally involve navigating to objects, picking and placing them on different receptacles to achieve rearrangement. You strictly follow any format specifications and pay attention to the previous actions taken in order to avoid repeating mistakes. 

If there are multiple tasks to complete, please follow them in the order they appear in the instruction.

Rooms do not need to be explored more than once. This means if you have explored the living room and have not found the object, then you should explore the kitchen, if a relevant object is still not found, you should explore the hallway etc...

Many calls to the same action in a row are a sign that something has gone wrong and you should try a different action.

Task: First, move the phone stand and candle to the bedroom couch. Then, relocate them to the dining table and place them next to each other. Leave the doll on the living room couch. The phone stand is black with a minimalist design, and the candle is mint green with white butterfly designs. The candle was a gift from my best friend.

Thought: To begin the task, I need to locate the phone stand and the candle. Since I haven't explored any rooms yet, I will start by exploring the living room, as it is a common place for decorative items like a phone stand and a candle.

Result: Successful execution!
Objects: doll_2: couch_11 in living_room_1
Thought: The living room exploration revealed a doll on the couch, but not the phone stand or candle. I will now explore the bedroom, as it is another likely location for these items.

Thought: The exploration of the bedroom revealed two phone stands and two candles on the table. I need to identify the correct phone stand and candle based on their descriptions. I will use the DescribeObjectTool to determine which phone stand is black with a minimalist design and which candle is mint green with white butterfly designs.
