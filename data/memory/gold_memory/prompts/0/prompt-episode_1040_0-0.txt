You are an agent that solves embodied-agent planning problems. The task assigned to you will be situated in a house and will generally involve navigating to objects, picking and placing them on different receptacles to achieve rearrangement. You strictly follow any format specifications and pay attention to the previous actions taken in order to avoid repeating mistakes. 

If there are multiple tasks to complete, please follow them in the order they appear in the instruction.

Rooms do not need to be explored more than once. This means if you have explored the living room and have not found the object, then you should explore the kitchen, if a relevant object is still not found, you should explore the hallway etc...

Many calls to the same action in a row are a sign that something has gone wrong and you should try a different action.

Task: Move the stuffed toy from the couch to the chair in the living room. Place it next to the table. I like to keep the stuffed toy next to the table on the chair for decoration and easy access during my reading time.

- Explore: Search a specific room by visiting various receptacles or furnitures in that room. The input to the skill is the EXACT name of the room to be visited. Use the room names provided in the house description. This tool exhaustivly explores the specified room. Example (Explore[kitchen_1])
- FindObjectTool: Used to find the exact name/names of the object/objects of interest. If you want to find the exact names of objects on specific receptacles or furnitures, please include that in the query. Example (FindObjectTool[toys on the floor] or FindObjectTool[apples])
- FindReceptacleTool: Used to know the exact name of a receptacle. A receptacle is a furniture or entity (like a chair, table, bed etc.) where you can place an object. Example (FindReceptacleTool[a kitchen counter])
- FindRoomTool: Used to know the exact name of a room in the house. A room is a region in the house where furniture is placed. Example (FindRoomTool[a room which might have something to eat])

- Pick: Used for picking up an object. You must provide the name of the object to be picked. The agent cannot hold more than one object at a time. Example (Pick[cup_1])
- Place: Used for placing an object on a target location. You need to provide the name of the object to be placed, the name of the furniture where it should be placed, spatial relation ("on" or "within") describing the relation between the object and furniture. The object to be placed must already be held by the agent (i.e. picked previously). In addition to these, you can request to place the object near another object. For that you can optionally provide a spatial constraints ("next_to") and the name of the reference object. To place next to an object, the reference object must already be on the target furniture. API template - Place[<object_to_be_placed>, <spatial_relation>, <furniture to be placed on>, <spatial_constraint>, <reference_object>]. spatial_constraint and reference_object should be set to "None" when necessary.
- Wait: Used to make agent stay idle for some time. Example (Wait[])
- Done: Used to indicate that the agent has finished the task. Example (Done[])

Thought: The task requires moving a stuffed toy from the couch to the chair in the living room. Since I need to find the stuffed toy first, I will explore the living room to locate it.

Explore[living_room_1]
Assigned!
Result: Successful execution!
Objects: bottle_1: shelves_24 in closet_1
cushion_3: couch_23 in living_room_1
stuffed_toy_0: couch_23 in living_room_1
Thought: I have found the stuffed toy on the couch in the living room. The next step is to navigate to the couch to pick up the stuffed toy.

Navigate[couch_23]
Assigned!
Result: Successful execution!
Objects: bottle_1: shelves_24 in closet_1
cushion_3: couch_23 in living_room_1
stuffed_toy_0: couch_23 in living_room_1
Thought: I have successfully navigated to the couch. Now, I will pick up the stuffed toy from the couch.

Pick[stuffed_toy_0]
Assigned!
Result: Successful execution!
Objects: bottle_1: shelves_24 in closet_1
cushion_3: couch_23 in living_room_1
stuffed_toy_0: held by the agent
Thought: I have successfully picked up the stuffed toy. The next step is to navigate to the chair in the living room where I need to place the stuffed toy.

Navigate[chair_32]
Assigned!
Result: Successful execution!
Objects: bottle_1: shelves_24 in closet_1
cushion_3: couch_23 in living_room_1
stuffed_toy_0: held by the agent
Thought: I have successfully navigated to the chair in the living room. Now, I will place the stuffed toy on the chair next to the table for decoration and easy access during reading time.

Place[stuffed_toy_0, on, chair_32, next_to, table_14]
Assigned!
Result: Unexpected failure! - No valid placements found for entity chair_32. It looks like the spatial constraint next_to is not feasible because the reference object table_14 either does not exist or has not yet been placed on the chair_32. Try placing the grasped object stuffed_toy_0 on chair_32 without the spatial constraint next_to.
Objects: bottle_1: shelves_24 in closet_1
cushion_3: couch_23 in living_room_1
stuffed_toy_0: held by the agent
Thought: The placement of the stuffed toy on the chair with the spatial constraint "next_to" the table failed because the table is not on the chair. I will place the stuffed toy on the chair without the spatial constraint.

Place[stuffed_toy_0, on, chair_32, None, None]
Assigned!
Result: Successful execution!
Objects: bottle_1: shelves_24 in closet_1
cushion_3: couch_23 in living_room_1
stuffed_toy_0: chair_32 in living_room_1
Thought: I have successfully placed the stuffed toy on the chair in the living room. The task of moving the stuffed toy from the couch to the chair is now complete.
