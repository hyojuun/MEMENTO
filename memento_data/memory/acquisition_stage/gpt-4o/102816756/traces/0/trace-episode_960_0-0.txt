Task: Move the book and candle from the living room couch to the dining table. Place them next to each other on the table. The book is beige titled 'UNIX' with a simple cover design, and the candle is white on a black holder. The book is a gift from my best friend.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the living room to locate the beige book titled 'UNIX' and the white candle on a black holder, as they are likely to be on the couch in that room.
