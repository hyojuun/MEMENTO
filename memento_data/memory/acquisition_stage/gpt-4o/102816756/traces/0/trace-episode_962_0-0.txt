Task: Help me prepare for lunch by moving the jug and cup from the kitchen counter to the dining table. Place them next to each other. The jug is light green with a curved spout, and the cup is light pink with Pantone 337 C marking. The cup is a gift from my best friend.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the kitchen to locate the light green jug with a curved spout and the light pink cup with Pantone 337 C marking.
