Task: Swap the can and bottle to office table? The can is silver and contains Polar Herring Fillets, Smoked & Peppered, 7.05 oz., and the bottle is black and white with a leaf pattern. The can is part of my favorite food collection.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring a room where the can and bottle might be located. A common place for food items like the can is the kitchen, so I will explore the kitchen first.
