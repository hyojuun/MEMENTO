Task: Move the stuffed toy, basket, and picture frame from the bedroom shelves to the living room table. Place them next to each other on the table. The stuffed toy is cream-colored, resembling a dog with a long nose, the basket is a teal plastic Spritz Easter Basket, and the picture frame is black adorned with teardrop-shaped embellishments. The stuffed toy was a gift from my best friend.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the bedroom_1 to locate the cream-colored stuffed toy resembling a dog with a long nose, the teal plastic Spritz Easter Basket, and the black picture frame adorned with teardrop-shaped embellishments, as they are likely to be on the shelves in that room.
