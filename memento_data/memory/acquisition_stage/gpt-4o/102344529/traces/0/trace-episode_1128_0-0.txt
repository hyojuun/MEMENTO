Task: Move the tray to the cabinet in the toilet room and put the can on the counter in the lounge. The tray is white with cutout handles, and the can is a silver can of Polar Herring Fillets, Smoked & Peppered, 7.05 oz. The tray is a gift from my grandmother.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring a room where the tray and the can might be located. A common place for a tray might be the kitchen or dining room, and for a can, it could be the kitchen or lounge. I will start by exploring the kitchen to see if either the tray or the can is there.
