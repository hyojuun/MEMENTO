Task: Move the dumbbell and shoe to the shelves in the living room and place them next to each other. I prefer to keep my workout equipment like dumbbells and shoes together on the living room shelves for easy access during workouts.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring a room to locate the dumbbell and shoe. The bedroom is a common place for workout equipment, so I will explore bedroom_1 first.
