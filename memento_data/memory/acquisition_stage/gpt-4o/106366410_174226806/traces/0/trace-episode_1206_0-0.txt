Task: Move the clock, then the vase, and finally the picture frame to the table in the living room. Then move them to the bench in the living room and place them next to each other. The clock is dark blue with a patterned face and a handle, the vase is tall and slender in dark green, and the picture frame is wooden with a colorful illustration inside. The vase is a gift from my friend.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the living room to locate the dark blue clock with a patterned face and a handle, the tall and slender dark green vase, and the wooden picture frame with a colorful illustration inside.
