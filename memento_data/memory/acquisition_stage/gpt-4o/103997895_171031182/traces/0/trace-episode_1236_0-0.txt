Task: Place the vase on the shelves, the candle on the table? The vase is white with a faceted design, and the candle is mint green with white butterfly designs. The vase is a family heirloom.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring a room that might contain the vase and the candle. The living room is a common place for decorative items like vases and candles, so I will explore it first.
