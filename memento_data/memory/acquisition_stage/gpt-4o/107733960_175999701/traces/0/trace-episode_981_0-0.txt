Task: Move the laptop and phone stand to the table in the office. Place them next to each other on the table. The laptop is black with a touchpad, and the phone stand is black with a minimalist design. They are the essential part of my work setup.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring a room that might contain the laptop and phone stand. The living room (living_room_1) is a common place for such items, so I will explore it first.
