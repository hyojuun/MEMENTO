Task: Put away the clock and vase by setting them on the washing machine. Set them next to each other. I prefer to keep the clock and vase together on the washing machine for easy access when I do laundry.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring a room that might contain the clock and vase. The living room is a common place for decorative items like clocks and vases, so I will explore it first.
