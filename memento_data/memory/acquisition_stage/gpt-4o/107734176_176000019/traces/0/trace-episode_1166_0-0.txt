Task: Move the jug and cup from the kitchen counter to the living room table. Then move the tray on the couch. I usually have the jug and cup on the living room table for serving drinks and the tray on the couch for easy access to snacks during movie nights.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the kitchen to locate the jug and cup on the counter.
