Task: Move the plant container from the living room table to the bedroom shelves. I prefer having my plant container on the bedroom shelves to create a calming atmosphere.
Thought: Since we need to move a plant container from the living room table to the bedroom shelves, we should start by exploring the living room to locate the plant container.
