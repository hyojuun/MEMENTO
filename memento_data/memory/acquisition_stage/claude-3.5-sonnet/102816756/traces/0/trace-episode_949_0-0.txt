Task: Put the candle holder, statue, and vase back on the table in the bedroom. The candle holder is white and tan with a rounded base, the statue is beige on a black base, and the vase is white with a rounded body and narrow neck. The vase was a gift from my best friend.
Thought: Since we haven't found any objects yet and we need to locate the candle holder, statue, and vase, we should start by exploring the bedroom where these items need to be placed.
