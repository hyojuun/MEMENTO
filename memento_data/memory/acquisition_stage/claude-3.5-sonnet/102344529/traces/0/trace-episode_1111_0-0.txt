Task: Move the kettle and tray from the laundry room/mudroom cabinet to the TV table. Place them next to each other on the table. I prefer having the kettle and tray on the TV table for easy access during movie nights.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, and the task mentions that the kettle and tray are in the laundry room/mudroom cabinet, I should start by exploring the laundry room to locate these items.
