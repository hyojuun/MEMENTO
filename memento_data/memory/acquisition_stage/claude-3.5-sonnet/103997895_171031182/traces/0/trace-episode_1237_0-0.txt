Task: Organize the bedroom. Put the vase, book, and clock on the chest of drawers. The vase is white with a beige geometric pattern, the book is a multicolored hardcover with a geometric design, and the clock is maroon with a green digital display. The book is a gift from my best friend.

Thought: We have successfully explored the bedroom, but we haven't found the vase, book, or clock that we need to organize. We only found a glass on the chest of drawers.
