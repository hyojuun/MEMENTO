Task: Move the jug and cup from the kitchen counter to the living room table. Place them next to each other. I prefer to have the jug and cup together in the living room for afternoon refreshments.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, and the task involves moving items from the kitchen counter, I should start by exploring the kitchen to locate the jug and cup.

Thought: I have identified multiple tables in the living room. Since the task doesn't specify which table to use, I'll choose table_10 for consistency. Now, I need to navigate to the living room and place the jug on table_10.
