Task: Move the lamp to the bedroom table. Move the statue to the living room shelves. The lamp is wooden with a white spherical shade, and the statue is black hand-shaped with a glossy finish. The lamp was a gift from my grandmother.
Thought: Since we haven't found any objects yet, and we're looking for a lamp and a statue, we should start by exploring the living room. The living room is a common place for decorative items like lamps and statues.
