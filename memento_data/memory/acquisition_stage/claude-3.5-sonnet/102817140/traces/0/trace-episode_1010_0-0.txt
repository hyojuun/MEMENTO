Task: Help me set up some visuals on the shelves. Move the picture frame and lamp there. The book can stay where it is. The lamp has a pineapple-shaped neon outline with a black base, and the picture frame is gold with a dark central image. The picture frame holds a special photo of my family reunion.
Thought: Since we haven't found any objects yet, and we're looking for a picture frame and a lamp with specific descriptions, we should start by exploring the living room. The living room is often where decorative items like picture frames and lamps are kept, and it's also mentioned to have shelves where we need to place these items.

Thought: We've successfully explored the living room and found several objects, including a book on the shelves. However, the lamp and picture frame we're looking for are not in the living room but on table_30 in the hallway. We need to navigate to the hallway to examine these objects more closely and determine if they match the descriptions given in the task.
