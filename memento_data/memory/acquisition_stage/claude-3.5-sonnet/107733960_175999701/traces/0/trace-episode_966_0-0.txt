Task: Move the laptop stand and multiport hub from the office table to the bedroom table. Place them next to each other on the table. I prefer to have my laptop stand and multiport hub together in the bedroom for my late-night work sessions.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the office, as that's where the laptop stand and multiport hub are likely to be located.
