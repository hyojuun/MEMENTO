Task: Move the stuffed toys and put them in the chest of drawers in the bedroom. I prefer to keep my stuffed toys in the bedroom chest of drawers for easy access and organization.
Thought: Since we need to move stuffed toys to the bedroom chest of drawers, we should first explore the living room, as it's a common place for stuffed toys to be located.
