Task: Help me tidy up the hallway shelves. First, move the book, vase, and stuffed toy to the living room table. Place them next to each other. The book has a colorful cover with architectural imagery, the vase is white with brown accents and a glossy finish, and the stuffed toy is a gray elephant with a soft, plush texture called Sootheze Cold Therapy Elephant. The vase is a gift from my friend.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the hallway_1 to locate the book, vase, and stuffed toy on the shelves.

Result: Incorrect syntax for place/rearrange skill. reference_object was valid, but corresponding spatial_constraint was none. This may not be the correct node name, try using appropriate tool to get the exact name. If that doesnt work, this node may just not exist yet, explore the house to discover.
