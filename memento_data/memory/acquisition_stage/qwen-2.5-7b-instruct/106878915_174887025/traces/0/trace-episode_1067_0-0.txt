Task: First, move the laptop from the living room to the bedroom and place it on the bedside table. Then move the laptop from the bedside table to the stool in the bedroom. I usually start my work in the bedroom by placing the laptop on the bedside table, and then move it to the stool for a more comfortable working position.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the living room to locate the laptop.

Result: Answer: After looking at the scene I can tell that the furniture that match the query are:
- table_13 in bedroom
- stool_15 in bedroom
- shelves_12 in bedroom, shelves_14 in bedroom
I did not find a specific "bedside table" but these items could be located near the beds in the bedroom.

Thought: Since there is no specific "bedside table" mentioned, I will assume one of the tables in the bedroom could be a bedside table. I will place the laptop on table_13, which is one of the tables in the bedroom.
