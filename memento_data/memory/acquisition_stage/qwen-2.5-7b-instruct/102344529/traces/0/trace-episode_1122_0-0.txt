Task: First, move the candle from the table to the chair in the tv room. Then, place it on the tv table. I usually reposition the candle in this way to prepare for a cozy evening.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the tv room to locate the candle on the table.

Thought: The agent is not holding any object because the candle was placed on the chair instead of being held by the agent. I need to pick up the candle from the chair before placing it on the table.
