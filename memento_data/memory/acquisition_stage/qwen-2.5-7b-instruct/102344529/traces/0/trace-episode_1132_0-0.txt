Task: Take the clock, vase, and candle from the table in the dining room and put them on the shelves in the tv room, placing them next to each other? The clock is a black vintage one with a round face and a small ring on top, the vase is colorful with a geometric mosaic pattern, and the candle is white on a black, geometric holder. The clock was a gift from my grandmother.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the dining room to locate the clock, vase, and candle on the table.

Thought: I have found multiple clocks, vases, and candles on the table in the dining room. I need to identify which objects match the descriptions provided: a black vintage clock with a round face and a small ring on top, a colorful vase with a geometric mosaic pattern, and a white candle on a black, geometric holder. I will use the DescribeObjectTool to determine which objects match these descriptions.

Thought: I have identified the exact position of the candle_2 as being on table_26 and 3.23 meters away from the agent in the dining room. Now, I will navigate to the exact position of the candle_2.

Thought: The node name "3.23_meters_from_agent_to_candle_2" does not exist in the graph. Instead, I should use the `Navigate` action to move closer to the candle_2 on the table_26 in the dining room by specifying a more appropriate node name. I will use the `FindReceptacleTool` to get the exact name of the table_26 and then navigate to it.
