Task: Move the plant container from the bedroom table to the living room table. Take the stuffed toy from the kitchen cabinet and put it on a bedroom table. The plant container is a colorful assortment of electric pots by Cole Hardware, and the stuffed toy is a gray bear with a paw print on its scarf. The stuffed toy bear is a gift from my friend.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the bedroom_1 to locate the colorful plant container with electric pots by Cole Hardware.
