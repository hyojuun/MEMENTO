Task: Move the clock to a new living room table. Also, move the candle holder to a new living room table. I prefer to have the clock and candle holder together on the new table for a cozy ambiance.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the living room to locate the clock and candle holder.

Thought: The previous attempt to place the candle holder next to the clock failed because the placement command was incorrect. I should use the "on" spatial relation instead of "next_to" since both the clock and candle holder are already on the same table.
