Task: Move the laptop and the mouse pad to a new living room table. Move the clock to another shelf. I prefer to have my laptop and mouse pad on the living room table for work, and the clock on a different shelf to keep track of time without cluttering my workspace.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the living room to locate the laptop and mouse pad.
