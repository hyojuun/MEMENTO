Task: Move a book and a pencil case from the bedroom to the living room. Place them on the table. The book has a cover image of a modern interior, and the pencil case is colorful with a paisley pattern, named Olive Kids Paisley Pencil Case. The book was a gift from a dear friend.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the bedroom_1 to locate the book and the colorful pencil case with a paisley pattern.
