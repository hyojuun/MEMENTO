Task: First, move the shoe and then the hat from the bedroom to the office and set them on the floor. Then, place them next to each other on the office table. I usually like to have my shoes and hat organized together on the office table for easy access when I leave.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the bedroom_1 to locate the shoe and the hat.

Result: Unexpected failure! - No valid placements found for entity table_61. It looks like the spatial constraint next_to is not feasible because the reference object hat_1 either does not exist or has not yet been placed on the table_61. Try placing the grasped object shoe_0 on table_61 without the spatial constraint next_to.
