Task: Help me set up some visuals on the shelves. Move the picture frame and lamp there. The book can stay where it is. The lamp has a pineapple-shaped neon outline with a black base, and the picture frame is gold with a dark central image. The picture frame holds a special photo of my family reunion.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the living room to locate the picture frame and lamp.
