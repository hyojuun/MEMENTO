Task: Move the candle holder, candle, and vase from the dining table to the living room shelves. Place them next to each other on the shelves. I prefer to have the candle holder, candle, and vase displayed together on the living room shelves for a cohesive look.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the dining room to locate the candle holder, candle, and vase on the dining table.

Thought: Since the dining room is not found, I should use the FindRoomTool to find the exact name of the room that might have a dining table.

Thought: Since the dining table is likely to be in the kitchen, I should explore the kitchen to locate the candle holder, candle, and vase on the dining table.
