Task: Help me move these objects from the workout room to the dining room. First, take the dumbbell from the table and place it on the dining table. Then, bring the tennis racquet from the chair and place it on another chair. Finally, take the basketball from the table and place it on the floor. I usually set up exercise equipment in the dining room to create an impromptu workout area.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the workout room to locate the dumbbell, tennis racquet, and basketball.
