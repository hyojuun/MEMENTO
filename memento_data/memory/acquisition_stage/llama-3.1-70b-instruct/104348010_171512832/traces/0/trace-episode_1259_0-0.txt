Task: Move the apple, the tomato, and the bread from the kitchen counter to the dining table. Place them next to each other on the table. I usually have these items arranged on the dining table for my breakfast.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the kitchen to locate the apple, tomato, and bread, as they are likely to be on the kitchen counter.

Thought: Although the Explore skill failed, it still managed to find the objects of interest, which are the apple, tomato, and bread, on the counter in the kitchen. Now, I need to pick up one of the objects, for example, the apple.
