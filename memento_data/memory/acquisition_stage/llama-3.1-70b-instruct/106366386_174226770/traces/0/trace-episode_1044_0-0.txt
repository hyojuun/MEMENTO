Task: Put the shoe and pencil case on the bedroom chest of drawers. The shoe is a black and orange sports shoe, F10_TRX_FG_ssscuo9tGxb, and the pencil case is colorful featuring butterflies and flowers, Olive Kids Butterfly Garden. The pencil case is a gift from my childhood friend.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the bedroom to locate the black and orange sports shoe and the colorful pencil case featuring butterflies and flowers.
