Task: Bring the book from the living room to the bedroom and place it on the chest of drawers. I prefer to keep the book on the chest of drawers in the bedroom for my bedtime reading routine.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the living room to locate the book, as it is a common place where books might be found.
