Task: Place the vase on the shelves, the candle on the table. I prefer to have the vase on the shelves and the candle on the table to create a cozy atmosphere in the room.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring a room that might contain a vase and a candle. The living room (living_room_1) is a common place for decorative items, so I will explore it first.

Thought: Since the living room (living_room_1) did not contain the vase or the candle, I should explore the bedroom (bedroom_2) next, as it is another common place where decorative items might be found. I also found a glass object in bedroom_2, which might be the vase.

Thought: I have found a glass object (glass_3) in bedroom_2, which might be the vase. However, I still need to find the candle. I will use the DescribeObjectTool to determine if glass_3 is indeed the vase.

Thought: The description of glass_3 is not available, so I will continue searching for the vase and the candle. I will explore another room that might contain these objects. The living room (living_room_1) did not have them, and bedroom_2 only had a glass object, so I will try the office (office_1) next.

Thought: The office (office_1) is not a valid room in this house. I will use the FindRoomTool to find a valid room name that might contain the vase and the candle.

Thought: I have already explored living_room_1 and bedroom_2, and I found a glass object in bedroom_2, but I still need to find the candle and confirm if the glass object is the vase. I will explore bedroom_1 next, as it might contain the candle or more information about the vase.

Thought: I have found the candle (candle_1) and a vase (vase_0) in bedroom_1, on the chest_of_drawers_32. I also found a cushion (cushion_2) on the chair_9, but it's not relevant to the task. I will use the DescribeObjectTool to confirm if vase_0 is indeed the vase I'm looking for.

Thought: I have confirmed that vase_0 is indeed a vase, and it matches the description of the vase I'm looking for. I also found the candle (candle_1) on the same chest_of_drawers_32. Now, I need to pick up the vase and place it on the shelves.
