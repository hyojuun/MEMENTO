Task: Move the toy airplane from the bedroom to the living room table. Place it next to the couch. I like to keep the toy airplane next to the couch so I can easily play with it while relaxing.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the bedroom to locate the toy airplane.
