Task: Move the statue and picture frame from the table in the living room to the shelves in the bedroom. Place them next to each other on the shelves. The statue is beige on a black base, and the picture frame is silver with an ornate border. The statue is a keepsake from my travels.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the living room to locate the statue and picture frame on the table.
