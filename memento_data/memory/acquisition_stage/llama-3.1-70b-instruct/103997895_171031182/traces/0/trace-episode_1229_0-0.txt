Task: Move the statue and picture frame from the table in the living room to the shelves in the bedroom. Place them next to each other on the shelves. I prefer to keep the statue and picture frame on the shelves in the bedroom to maintain a cohesive decor.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the living room to locate the statue and picture frame on the table.
