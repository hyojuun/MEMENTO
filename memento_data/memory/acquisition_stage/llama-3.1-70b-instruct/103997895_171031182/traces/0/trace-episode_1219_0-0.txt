Task: Move the laptop and mouse pad from the table in the bedroom to the counter in the kitchen. Place them next to each other on the counter. I like to keep my laptop and mouse pad on the kitchen counter for morning work sessions.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring a room that might contain the laptop and mouse pad. The bedroom is a common place for these items, so I will explore bedroom_2 first.

Thought: I attempted to pick up the mouse pad but failed because I am currently holding the laptop. I need to place the laptop on a surface before I can pick up the mouse pad. However, I should not place the laptop on the counter in the kitchen yet, because I need to place the laptop and mouse pad next to each other. I will place the laptop on the table in the bedroom temporarily.
