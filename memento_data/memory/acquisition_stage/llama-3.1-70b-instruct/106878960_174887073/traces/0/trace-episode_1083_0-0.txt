Task: Move the tray and plate from the hallway couch to the counter. Place them next to each other on the counter. I prefer to have the tray and plate together on the counter for easy access during meal prep.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the hallway_1 to locate the tray and plate on the couch_33.
