Task: Move a book and a pencil case from the bedroom to the living room. Place them on the table. I usually keep my book and pencil case in the living room for my afternoon study sessions.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring a room that might contain a book and a pencil case. I will begin with the bedroom, as it is a common place for these items to be located.
