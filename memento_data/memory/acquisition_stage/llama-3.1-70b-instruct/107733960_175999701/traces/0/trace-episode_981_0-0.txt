Task: Move the laptop and phone stand to the table in the office. Place them next to each other on the table. The laptop is black with a touchpad, and the phone stand is black with a minimalist design. They are the essential part of my work setup.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the office to locate the laptop and phone stand.

Thought: Since the office does not contain the laptop and phone stand, I should explore another room that might contain them. The living room is a common place for electronic devices, so I will explore it next.
