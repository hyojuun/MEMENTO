Task: Move the phone stand to the TV table and the statue to the lounge counter. I prefer to keep the phone stand on the TV table and the statue on the lounge counter for better aesthetics and accessibility.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the tv room to locate the phone stand, as it is likely to be on the TV table.

Thought: I have found the statue on the table in the tv room, but the phone stand is actually on the lounge counter, not the TV table. I need to pick up the statue from the table in the tv room.
