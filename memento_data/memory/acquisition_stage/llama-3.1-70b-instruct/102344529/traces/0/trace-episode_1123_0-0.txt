Task: Move the phone stand to a new dining room chair. Also, move the statue to a new dining room chair. The phone stand is silver and light blue with a sleek design, and the statue is dark bronze with elongated features. The statue was a gift from my best friend.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the dining room to locate the silver and light blue phone stand and the dark bronze statue.

Thought: I have found multiple phone stands and statues on table_26 in the dining room. I need to identify which phone stand is the silver and light blue one with a sleek design, and which statue is the dark bronze one with elongated features. I will use the DescribeObjectTool to get more information about these objects.
