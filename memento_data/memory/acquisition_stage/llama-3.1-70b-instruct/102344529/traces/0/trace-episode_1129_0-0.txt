Task: Move the toy airplane and toy vehicle from the TV table to the garage bench. Place them next to each other on the bench. The toy airplane is red and white with a pilot, and the toy vehicle is a blue toy train with a smiling face, Thomas & Friends Wooden Railway Talking Thomas. Both toys are part of my cherished collection.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the TV room to locate the toy airplane and toy vehicle on the TV table.
