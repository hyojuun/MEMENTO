Task: Put the cup on the kitchen counter. Can you also move the laptop stand to a different kitchen counter? The cup is gray with a handle and two white birds design, and the laptop stand is black with foldable legs. The cup is my favorite mug.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the kitchen to locate the cup and laptop stand.

Thought: Although I have explored the kitchen, I still haven't found the cup and laptop stand. I should try to find them by exploring other rooms in the house, starting with the living room.

Thought: I have found multiple laptop stands and cups on table_18 in the living room. I need to identify which cup is the gray cup with a handle and two white birds design, and which laptop stand is the black one with foldable legs. I will use the DescribeObjectTool to get more information about each cup and laptop stand.
