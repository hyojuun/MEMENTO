Task: Move the candle from the living room stand to the office chair and place it next to the table. The candle is blue and black with a textured pattern. This candle was a gift from my friend.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the living room to locate the blue and black candle with a textured pattern.

Result: Incorrect syntax for place/rearrange skill. Spatial_constraint was valid, but corresponding reference_object was none. Ensure that the spatial constraint is required for rearranging this object, else try without it. Alternatively, the reference_object entity might be erroneous.. Use the appropriate tool to get a valid name.
