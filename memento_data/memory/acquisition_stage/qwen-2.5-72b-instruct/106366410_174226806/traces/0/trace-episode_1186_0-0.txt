Task: Move the toy airplane and stuffed toy from the bedroom table to the workout table. Place them next to each other on the table. I like to keep the toys together on the workout table for when the kids play while I exercise.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the bedroom to locate the toy airplane and stuffed toy on the table.
