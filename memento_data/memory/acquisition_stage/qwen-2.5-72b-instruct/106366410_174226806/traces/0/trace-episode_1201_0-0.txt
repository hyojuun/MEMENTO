Task: Move the toy airplane and stuffed toy from the bedroom table to the workout table. Place them next to each other on the table. The toy airplane is a red Air Hogs Wind Flyers Set, and the stuffed toy is a green and blue two-headed dragon from Animal Planet Foam. They are part of my favorite childhood toys.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the bedroom_1 to locate the toy airplane and stuffed toy on the table.
