Task: Put the candle holder, statue, and vase back on the table in the bedroom. I prefer to have the candle holder, statue, and vase arranged on the bedroom table for a calming atmosphere.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the bedroom to locate the candle holder, statue, and vase.
