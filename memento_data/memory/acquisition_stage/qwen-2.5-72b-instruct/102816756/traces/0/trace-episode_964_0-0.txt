Task: First, move the pen from the living room table to the shelves. Then, place it on the floor next to the bed in the bedroom. The pen is white with black accents. It's my lucky pen.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the living room to locate the white pen with black accents.

Thought: The exploration of the living room took too long, but it has provided me with the location of the pens. I need to identify which pen is the white one with black accents. I will use the DescribeObjectTool to get more information about the pens found on table_38.

Result: Unexpected failure! - No valid placements found for entity floor_bedroom_1. It looks like the spatial constraint next_to is not feasible because the reference object bed_49 either does not exist or has not yet been placed on the floor_bedroom_1.
