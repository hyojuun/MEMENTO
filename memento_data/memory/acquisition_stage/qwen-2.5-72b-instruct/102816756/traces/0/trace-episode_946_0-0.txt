Task: Move the jug and cup from the kitchen counter to the dining table. Place them next to each other on the table. I like to have the jug and cup next to each other on the dining table for easy access during meals.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the kitchen to locate the jug and cup on the counter.
