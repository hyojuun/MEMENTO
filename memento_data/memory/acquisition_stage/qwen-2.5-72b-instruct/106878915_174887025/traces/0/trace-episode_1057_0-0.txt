Task: Move the plate from the dining table to the bedroom shelves. Place it next to the bed. I usually keep a plate next to the bed for late-night snacks.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the dining room to locate the plate on the dining table.

Thought: Since the dining room is not explicitly listed, I will use the FindReceptacleTool to find the exact name of the dining table where the plate might be located.

However, the specific location "bedroom_1" is not mentioned for the shelves. The shelves are located in the bedroom but without more details, I cannot confirm if they are in "bedroom_1" or another part of the bedroom.

Thought: I have successfully navigated to shelves_12 in bedroom_1. Now, I need to place the plate on the shelves next to the bed. I will first check if there is a bed nearby to confirm the spatial relation.

FindReceptacleTool[bed in bedroom_1]

Result: - bed_17 in bedroom, bed_19 in bedroom

However, the specific mention of "bedroom_1" is not directly addressed in the provided information. Both beds are located in the bedroom, but there is no distinction between different bedroom areas. If you need to identify which bed is in a specific part of the bedroom, additional information would be required.

Thought: Since both beds are located in the bedroom and there is no specific distinction, I will assume bed_17 is in bedroom_1. I will place the plate on shelves_12 next to bed_17.
