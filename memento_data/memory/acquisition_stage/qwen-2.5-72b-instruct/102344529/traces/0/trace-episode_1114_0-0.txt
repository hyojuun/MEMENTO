Task: Move the phone stand to the TV table and the statue to the lounge counter. I prefer to keep the phone stand on the TV table and the statue on the lounge counter for better aesthetics and accessibility.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the tv_1 room to locate the phone stand, as it is a common place for a phone stand to be located.
