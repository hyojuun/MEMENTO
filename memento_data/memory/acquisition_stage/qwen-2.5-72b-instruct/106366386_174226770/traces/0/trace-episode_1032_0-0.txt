Task: Put the shoe and pencil case on the bedroom chest of drawers. I prefer to keep my shoe and pencil case on the chest of drawers for quick access when I'm getting ready in the morning.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore a room that might contain the shoe and pencil case. The bedroom is a common place for personal items like shoes and pencil cases, so I will start by exploring bedroom_1.
