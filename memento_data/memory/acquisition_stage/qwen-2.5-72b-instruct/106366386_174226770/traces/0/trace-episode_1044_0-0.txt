Task: Put the shoe and pencil case on the bedroom chest of drawers. The shoe is a black and orange sports shoe, F10_TRX_FG_ssscuo9tGxb, and the pencil case is colorful featuring butterflies and flowers, Olive Kids Butterfly Garden. The pencil case is a gift from my childhood friend.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring a room that might contain the black and orange sports shoe and the colorful pencil case. The bedroom (bedroom_1) is a likely place to find these items, so I will explore it first.

Thought: The exploration of the bedroom did not yield the objects I was looking for. I will now explore the living room (living_room_1) as it is another common place where such items might be found.

Thought: The living room did not contain the specific objects I was looking for, but I found them in the kitchen. I need to identify the correct shoe and pencil case. I will start by describing the shoes to determine which one is the black and orange sports shoe, F10_TRX_FG_ssscuo9tGxb.
