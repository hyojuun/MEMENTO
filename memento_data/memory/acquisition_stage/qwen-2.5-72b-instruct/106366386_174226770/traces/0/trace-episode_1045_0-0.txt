Task: Move the candle holder, candle, and plant container from the dining table to the living room couch? Place them next to each other on the couch. The candle holder is white with a gold rim on a wooden base, the candle is blue and brown with a gradient pattern, and the plant container is a white and green orchid pot called Cole Hardware Orchid Pot 85. The candle holder and candle are part of my decorative set.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the dining room to locate the candle holder, candle, and plant container on the dining table.
