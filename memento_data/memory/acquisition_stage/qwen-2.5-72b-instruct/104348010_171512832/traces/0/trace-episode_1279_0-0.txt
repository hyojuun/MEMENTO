Task: First, move the clock and then the picture frame from the living room shelves to the bedroom table. Then place them next to each other on the table. The clock is round and white with black numbers and a brown frame. The picture frame is ornate with a gold and blue design. The clock was a gift from my grandmother.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the living room to locate the round white clock with black numbers and a brown frame, and the ornate gold and blue picture frame.

Thought: I have found multiple clocks and picture frames on the shelves in the living room. I need to identify the specific clock and picture frame described in the task. I will use the DescribeObjectTool to determine which objects match the descriptions.
