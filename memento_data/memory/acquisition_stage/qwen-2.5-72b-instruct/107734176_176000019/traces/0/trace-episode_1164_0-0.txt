Task: Move the plant saucer and plant container from the table in the living room to the bench in the bathroom. Place them next to each other. I usually keep my plants in the bathroom for better humidity and sunlight exposure.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the living room to locate the plant saucer and plant container on the table.
