Task: Move the picture frame and clock to the table in the bedroom. Then, place them next to each other on the counter in the kitchen. The picture frame is black with teardrop-shaped embellishments, and the clock is a dark green analog alarm clock with twin bells. The clock was a gift from my grandfather.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the living room to locate the black picture frame with teardrop-shaped embellishments and the dark green analog alarm clock with twin bells.

However, the query specifies "bedroom_1," and the information provided does not specify which bedroom is bedroom_1. If bedroom_1 is the bedroom where table_26 is located, then the answer is as above. If you can provide more details about which bedroom is bedroom_1, I can refine the answer further.
