Task: Move the vase, candle holder, and picture frame from the living room to the office? Place them on the table. The vase is tall and light green, the candle holder is white and tan with a rounded base, and the picture frame is gray with a wavy border. The picture frame is a gift from my best friend.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the living room to locate the vase, candle holder, and picture frame.
