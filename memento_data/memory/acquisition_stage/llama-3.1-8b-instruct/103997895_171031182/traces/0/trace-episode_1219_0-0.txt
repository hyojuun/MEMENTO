Task: Move the laptop and mouse pad from the table in the bedroom to the counter in the kitchen. Place them next to each other on the counter. I like to keep my laptop and mouse pad on the kitchen counter for morning work sessions.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring a room that might contain the laptop and mouse pad. The bedroom is a common place for these items, so I will explore it first.

Result: Unexpected failure! - No valid placements found for entity counter_29. It looks like the spatial constraint next_to is not feasible because the reference object laptop_0 either does not exist or has not yet been placed on the counter_29. Try placing the grasped object mouse_pad_1 on counter_29 without the spatial constraint next_to.
