Task: Place the vase on the shelves, the candle on the table? The vase is white with a faceted design, and the candle is mint green with white butterfly designs. The vase is a family heirloom.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore a room that might contain the white vase with a faceted design and the mint green candle with white butterfly designs. The living room (living_room_1) is a common place for decorative items, so I will explore it first.

Thought: The living room (living_room_1) did not contain the objects I was looking for. I will explore the kitchen (kitchen_1) next, as it is another common place where decorative items might be found.
