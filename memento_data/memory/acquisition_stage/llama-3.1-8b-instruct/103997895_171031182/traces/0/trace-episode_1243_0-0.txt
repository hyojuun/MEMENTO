Task: Move the picture frame and clock to the table in the bedroom. Then, place them next to each other on the counter in the kitchen. The picture frame is black with teardrop-shaped embellishments, and the clock is a dark green analog alarm clock with twin bells. The clock was a gift from my grandfather.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore a room that might contain the picture frame and clock. The living room (living_room_1) is a common place for decorative items, so I will explore it first.
