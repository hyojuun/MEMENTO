Task: Organize the bedroom. Put the vase, book, and clock on the chest of drawers. I prefer to have the vase, book, and clock neatly arranged on the chest of drawers for a tidy look.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore a room that might contain the vase, book, and clock. The bedroom_1 is a common place to find decorative items like vases and books, so I will explore it first.

Thought: Since I have already found a vase and picked it up, and now I need to find the book and the clock. The book is likely to be found on the floor or a table. I will explore the table_31 in bedroom_1 to find the book.
