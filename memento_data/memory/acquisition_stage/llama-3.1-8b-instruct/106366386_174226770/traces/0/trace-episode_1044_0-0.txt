Task: Put the shoe and pencil case on the bedroom chest of drawers. The shoe is a black and orange sports shoe, F10_TRX_FG_ssscuo9tGxb, and the pencil case is colorful featuring butterflies and flowers, Olive Kids Butterfly Garden. The pencil case is a gift from my childhood friend.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore a room that might contain the shoe and pencil case. The bedroom_1 is a common place where personal items like shoes and pencil cases are often found, so I will explore it first.
