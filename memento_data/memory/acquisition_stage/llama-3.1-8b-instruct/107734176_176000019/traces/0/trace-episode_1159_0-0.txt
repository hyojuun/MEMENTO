Task: Put away the clock and vase by setting them on the washing machine. Set them next to each other. I prefer to keep the clock and vase together on the washing machine for easy access when I do laundry.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring a room that might contain the clock and vase. The living room (living_room_1) is a common place for decorative items, so I will explore it first.
