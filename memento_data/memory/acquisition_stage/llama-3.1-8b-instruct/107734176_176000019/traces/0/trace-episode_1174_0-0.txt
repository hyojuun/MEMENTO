Task: Move the vase and picture frame from the living room table to the lounge chair. Place them next to each other on the chair. The vase is dark blue with a faceted design, and the picture frame has a light blue border with multicolored accents. The dark blue vase is my personal favorite.
Thought: Since we are going to move the vase and picture frame, I should start by exploring the living room to locate them on the table.

Thought: Since I have found the vase and the picture frames on the table in the living room, I should find the exact names of the vase and the picture frames and determine which one matches the description. I will use the DescribeObjectTool to get more information about these objects and determine which ones match the descriptions provided.
