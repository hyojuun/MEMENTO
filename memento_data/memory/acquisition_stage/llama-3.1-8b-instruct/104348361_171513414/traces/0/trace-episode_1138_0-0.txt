Task: Move the clock to a new living room table. Also, move the candle holder to a new living room table. I prefer to have the clock and candle holder together on the new table for a cozy ambiance.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the living room to locate the clock and candle holder.
