Task: First, move the shoe and then the hat from the bedroom to the office and set them on the floor. Then, place them next to each other on the office table. The shoe is a white and silver ASICS with royal blue accents, GEL-1140V model, and the hat is a beige straw with a black band, DPC Tropical Trends Hat. The shoe and the hat are part of my travel essentials.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore a room I have not explored yet.
