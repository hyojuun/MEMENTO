Task: Move the laptop and phone stand to the table in the office. Place them next to each other on the table. The laptop is black with a touchpad, and the phone stand is black with a minimalist design. They are the essential part of my work setup.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring a room that might contain the laptop and phone stand. The office (office_1) is a common place for these items, so I will explore it first.

Thought: The office (office_1) did not contain the objects I was looking for. I should explore another room that might contain the laptop and phone stand. The living room (living_room_1) is a common place for these items, so I will explore it next.
