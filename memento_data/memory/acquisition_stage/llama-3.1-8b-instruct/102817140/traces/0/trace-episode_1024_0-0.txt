Task: Move the dumbbell and shoe to the shelves in the living room and place them next to each other. The dumbbell is black and hexagonal with a metal handle, and the shoe is a black and pink running shoe, PureConnect 2. The shoe is part of my favorite running gear.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring a room that might contain the dumbbell and shoe. The living room (living_room_1) is a common place for exercise equipment and shoes, so I will explore it first.
