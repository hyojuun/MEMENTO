Task: Move the lamp and then the vase from the table in the living room to the shelves, placing them next to each other. I prefer to keep the lamp and vase together on the shelves for a balanced look and easy access.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the living room to locate the lamp and vase on the table.
