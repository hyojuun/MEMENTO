Task: Put away the action figure and tray in the bedroom. Leave one action figure on the table. Take the tray and put it on the bed. I usually like to have an action figure on the table and the tray on the bed for easy access when I'm relaxing in the bedroom.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring the bedroom to locate the action figure and tray.

Thought: There seems to be a mistake, the tray was placed on bed_57, but unfortunately, the correct bed is actually in bedroom_2 not bedroom_1. I will navigate to the correct bedroom and pick up the action figure to place it on the table in the same room, to leave one action figure on the table.
