Task: Swap the can and bottle to office table? The can is silver and contains Polar Herring Fillets, Smoked & Peppered, 7.05 oz., and the bottle is black and white with a leaf pattern. The can is part of my favorite food collection.
Thought:Since I need to swap the can and the bottle to the office table and I don't know their current location yet, I should start by exploring a room where they might be located.
