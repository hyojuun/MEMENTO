Task: Move the apple, the tomato, and the bread from the kitchen counter to the dining table. Place them next to each other on the table. I usually have these items arranged on the dining table for my breakfast.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring a room that might contain the apple, the tomato, and the bread. The kitchen (kitchen_1) is a common place for these items, so I will explore it first.
