Task: Move the book and candle from the living room couch to the dining table. Place them next to each other on the table. The book is beige titled 'UNIX' with a simple cover design, and the candle is white on a black holder. The book is a gift from my best friend.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore a room that might contain the book and candle. The living room (living_room_1) is a common place where these items might be found, so I will explore it first.
