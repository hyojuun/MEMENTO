Task: Bring the book from the living room to the bedroom and place it on the chest of drawers. The book is white with subtle yellow accents and a bookmark. This book was a gift from my friend.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring a room that might contain a book. The living room (living_room_1) is a common place for books, so I will explore it first.

Thought: Since the Explore skill took too long to finish, I should try a different approach to find the book. I will use the FindObjectTool to search for the book in the living room.

Thought: I have found two books on table_48 in the living room. I need to determine which one is the white book with subtle yellow accents and a bookmark. I will use the DescribeObjectTool to get more information about these books.

DescribeObjectTool[book_0]

Result: The description of the object 'book_0' is:
