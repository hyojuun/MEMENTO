Task: First, move the pen from the living room table to the shelves. Then, place it on the floor next to the bed in the bedroom. The pen is white with black accents. It's my lucky pen.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring a room that might contain the pen. The living room (living_room_1) is a common place for pens, so I will explore it first.

Thought: I was able to explore the living room and found two pens on table_38. I will now pick up one of the pens to move it to the shelves and then to the floor next to the bed in the bedroom.

Thought: Since I have multiple options for which pen to pick, I will choose the one that is most likely to be the user's lucky pen. I will use the DescribeObjectTool to get more information about each pen.
