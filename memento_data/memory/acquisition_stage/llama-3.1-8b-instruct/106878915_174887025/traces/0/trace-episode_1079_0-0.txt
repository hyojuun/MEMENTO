Task: First, move the clock from the table in the bedroom to the stand and place it next to the vase. Then, move the vase from the stand in the bedroom to the shelves in the living room. The clock is maroon and square with a patterned face, and the vase is black with a round shape. The clock was a gift from my grandfather.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should explore the bedroom_2 to locate the maroon and square clock with a patterned face and the black vase with a round shape.
