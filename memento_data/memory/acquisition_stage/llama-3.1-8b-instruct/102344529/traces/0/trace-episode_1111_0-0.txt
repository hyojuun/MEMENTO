Task: Move the kettle and tray from the laundry room/mudroom cabinet to the TV table. Place them next to each other on the table. I prefer having the kettle and tray on the TV table for easy access during movie nights.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring a room to locate the kettle and tray. I will begin with the laundry room/mudroom, as it is a common place for a kettle and tray to be located.

Result: Unexpected failure! - No valid placements found for entity table_37.
