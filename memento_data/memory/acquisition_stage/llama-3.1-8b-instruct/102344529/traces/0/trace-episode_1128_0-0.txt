Task: Move the tray to the cabinet in the toilet room and put the can on the counter in the lounge. The tray is white with cutout handles, and the can is a silver can of Polar Herring Fillets, Smoked & Peppered, 7.05 oz. The tray is a gift from my grandmother.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring a room where the tray and can might be located. A common place for a tray is the kitchen or dining room, and a can might be found in the kitchen or pantry. However, since the task specifies the cabinet in the toilet room and the counter in the lounge, I will explore the toilet room first to see if the tray is already there.
