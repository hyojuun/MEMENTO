Task: First, move the candle from the table to the chair in the tv room. Then, place it on the tv table. I usually reposition the candle in this way to prepare for a cozy evening.
Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring a room that might contain the candle. The tv room (tv_1) is a common place for candles, so I will explore it first.
