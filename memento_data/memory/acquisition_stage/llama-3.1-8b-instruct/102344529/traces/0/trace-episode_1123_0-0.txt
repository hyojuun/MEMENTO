Task: Move the phone stand to a new dining room chair. Also, move the statue to a new dining room chair. The phone stand is silver and light blue with a sleek design, and the statue is dark bronze with elongated features. The statue was a gift from my best friend.
Thought: Since I need to move the phone stand and the statue to new dining room chairs, I should start by exploring the dining room to locate the phone stand and the statue.
