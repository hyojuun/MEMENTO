Task: Move the phone stand to the tv table. Move the statue to the lounge counter. The phone stand is black with a minimalist design, and the statue is green of a sitting dog. The statue was a gift from my best friend.
Thought: To begin the task, I need to locate the phone stand and the statue. Since I have not explored any rooms yet, I will start by exploring the first room in the list, which is the garage_1, to see if either of the objects is there.
