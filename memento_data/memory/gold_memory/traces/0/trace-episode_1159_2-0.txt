Task: Put away the clock and vase by setting them on the washing machine. Set them next to each other. I prefer to keep the clock and vase together on the washing machine for easy access when I do laundry.
Thought: To complete the task of placing the clock and vase on the washing machine, I first need to locate these objects. I will start by exploring the living room, as it is a common place for decorative items like clocks and vases.
