Task: Help me tidy up the living room. First, move the vase and stuffed toy from the table to the couch. Place them next to each other. I like to have the vase and stuffed toy together on the couch during cleaning for easy access later.
Thought: To begin tidying up the living room, I need to locate the vase and stuffed toy on the table in the living room. I will start by exploring the living room to find these objects.
