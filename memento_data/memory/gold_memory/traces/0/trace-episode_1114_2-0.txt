Task: Move the phone stand to the TV table and the statue to the lounge counter. I prefer to keep the phone stand on the TV table and the statue on the lounge counter for better aesthetics and accessibility.
Thought: To complete the task, I need to locate the phone stand and the statue. I will start by exploring the rooms to find these objects. I will begin with the tv_1 room, as it might contain the TV table where the phone stand needs to be placed.
