pen_0: table_38 in living_room_1
Thought: The exploration of the living room was unsuccessful due to a timeout. However, I have information that there are two pens on table_38 in the living room. I will now find the exact name of the white pen with black accents.

pen_3: table_38 in living_room_1
pen_0: table_38 in living_room_1
Thought: Since the FindObjectTool did not return a specific match for the white pen with black accents, I will use the DescribeObjectTool to get more information about the pens on table_38 to identify the correct one.

Result: No specific bed was found in bedroom_1. I was able to find the following beds in the bedroom:

tape_2: shelves_24 in kitchen_1
Thought: The FindReceptacleTool did not return a specific bed in bedroom_1, but based on the furniture list, bed_49 is located in bedroom_1. I will place the pen_0 on the floor next to bed_49.

Place[pen_0, on, floor_bedroom_1, next_to, bed_49]
Assigned!
Result: Unexpected failure! - No valid placements found for entity floor_bedroom_1. It looks like the spatial constraint next_to is not feasible because the reference object bed_49 either does not exist or has not yet been placed on the floor_bedroom_1. Try placing the grasped object pen_0 on floor_bedroom_1 without the spatial constraint next_to.
Objects: spray_bottle_1: chair_42 in bedroom_1

pen_0: held by the agent
tape_2: shelves_24 in kitchen_1
Thought: The attempt to place the pen_0 on the floor next to bed_49 failed due to a spatial constraint issue. I will place the pen_0 directly on the floor in bedroom_1 without the spatial constraint.
