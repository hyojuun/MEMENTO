Task: Put the candle holder, statue, and vase back on the table in the bedroom. I prefer to have the candle holder, statue, and vase arranged on the bedroom table for a calming atmosphere.
Thought: To complete the task, I need to find the candle holder, statue, and vase and place them on the table in bedroom_1. Since no objects have been found yet, I will start by exploring bedroom_1 to see if any of these objects are already there.
