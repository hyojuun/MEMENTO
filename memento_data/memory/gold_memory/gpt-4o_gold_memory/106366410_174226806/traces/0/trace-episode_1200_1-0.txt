Task: Move the dumbbell, tennis racquet, and spray bottle from the workout table to the office table. The dumbbell is green with a smooth finish, the tennis racquet is black with a brown handle, and the spray bottle is transparent with a sleek design. The dumbbell and tennis racquet are part of my personal workout gear.
Thought: The task requires moving specific objects from the workout table to the office table. First, I need to explore the workout room to locate the objects: the green dumbbell, the black tennis racquet with a brown handle, and the transparent spray bottle.
