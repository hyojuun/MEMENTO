Task: Help me set up some visuals on the shelves. Move the picture frame and lamp there. The book can stay where it is. The lamp has a pineapple-shaped neon outline with a black base, and the picture frame is gold with a dark central image. The picture frame holds a special photo of my family reunion.
Thought: To set up the visuals on the shelves, I need to locate the picture frame and the lamp. I will start by exploring the living room, as it is a common place for decorative items like picture frames and lamps.
