Task: Put the candle holder, statue, and vase back on the table in the bedroom. The candle holder is white and tan with a rounded base, the statue is beige on a black base, and the vase is white with a rounded body and narrow neck. The vase was a gift from my best friend.
Thought: To complete the task, I need to locate the candle holder, statue, and vase. I will start by exploring the bedroom_1, as the task requires placing these objects on the table in this room, and they might already be present here.
