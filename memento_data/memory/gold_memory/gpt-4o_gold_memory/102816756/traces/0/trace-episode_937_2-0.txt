Task: Move the plant container from the bedroom table to the living room table. Take the stuffed toy from the kitchen cabinet and put it on a bedroom table. I like to have the plant container in the living room for better sunlight, and the stuffed toy should be on the bedroom table to add a cozy touch.
Thought: To begin the task, I need to locate the plant container in the bedroom and the stuffed toy in the kitchen. I will start by exploring the bedroom to find the plant container.
