You are an agent that solves embodied-agent planning problems. The task assigned to you will be situated in a house and will generally involve navigating to objects, picking and placing them on different receptacles to achieve rearrangement. You strictly follow any format specifications and pay attention to the previous actions taken in order to avoid repeating mistakes. 

If there are multiple tasks to complete, please follow them in the order they appear in the instruction.

Rooms do not need to be explored more than once. This means if you have explored the living room and have not found the object, then you should explore the kitchen, if a relevant object is still not found, you should explore the hallway etc...

Many calls to the same action in a row are a sign that something has gone wrong and you should try a different action.

Task: Move the clock to a new living room table. Also, move the candle holder to a new living room table. The clock is brown and black with a green display, and the candle holder is white with a gold rim on a wooden base. The candle holder is a gift from my friend.

For that you can optionally provide a spatial constraints ("next_to") and the name of the reference object. To place next to an object, the reference object must already be on the target furniture. API template - Place[<object_to_be_placed>, <spatial_relation>, <furniture to be placed on>, <spatial_constraint>, <reference_object>]. spatial_constraint and reference_object should be set to "None" when necessary.

Thought: To complete the task, I need to locate the clock and the candle holder in the house. Since the task involves moving these objects to a new living room table, I will start by exploring the living room to see if these objects are already there.

Explore[living_room_1]
Assigned!
Result: Successful execution!
Objects: candle_holder_4: table_22 in living_room_1
clock_0: table_22 in living_room_1
candle_holder_1: table_22 in living_room_1
clock_3: table_22 in living_room_1
Thought: I have found multiple clocks and candle holders on table_22 in the living room. I need to identify the specific clock and candle holder described in the task. I will use the DescribeObjectTool to get more details about these objects.

DescribeObjectTool[clock_0]
Assigned!
Result: The description of the object 'clock_0' is:
A brown and black digital clock with a green display.
Objects: candle_holder_4: table_22 in living_room_1
clock_0: table_22 in living_room_1
candle_holder_1: table_22 in living_room_1
clock_3: table_22 in living_room_1
Thought: The description of 'clock_0' matches the clock described in the task. I will now identify the correct candle holder by describing the candle holders found on table_22.

DescribeObjectTool[candle_holder_4]
Assigned!
Result: The description of the object 'candle_holder_4' is:
A white and tan candle holder with a rounded base.
Objects: candle_holder_4: table_22 in living_room_1
clock_0: table_22 in living_room_1
candle_holder_1: table_22 in living_room_1
clock_3: table_22 in living_room_1
Thought: The description of 'candle_holder_4' does not match the candle holder described in the task. I will now describe 'candle_holder_1' to see if it matches the task description.

DescribeObjectTool[candle_holder_1]
Assigned!
Result: The description of the object 'candle_holder_1' is:
A white candle holder with a gold rim on a wooden base.
Objects: candle_holder_4: table_22 in living_room_1
clock_0: table_22 in living_room_1
candle_holder_1: table_22 in living_room_1
clock_3: table_22 in living_room_1
Thought: The description of 'candle_holder_1' matches the candle holder described in the task. I have identified both the clock and the candle holder that need to be moved. Now, I need to find a new table in the living room to place these objects.

FindReceptacleTool[new table in living_room_1]
Assigned!
Result: No new table was found in living_room_1. I was able to find the following tables in the living room though:
- table_18 in living_room, table_22 in living_room, table_23 in living_room
Objects: candle_holder_4: table_22 in living_room_1
clock_0: table_22 in living_room_1
candle_holder_1: table_22 in living_room_1
clock_3: table_22 in living_room_1
Thought: Since there is no explicitly labeled "new" table in the living room, I will choose a different table from the ones available, other than table_22, to place the clock and candle holder. I will use table_23 for this purpose. First, I will pick up the clock.

Thought: I have successfully picked up the clock. Now, I will place it on table_23 in the living room.

candle_holder_1: table_22 in living_room_1
clock_3: table_22 in living_room_1
