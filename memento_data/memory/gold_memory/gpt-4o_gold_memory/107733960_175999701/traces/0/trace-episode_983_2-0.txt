Task: First, move the vase and statue to the other shelves in the living room. Then, place them next to each other on the table in the living room. The vase is black with a bulbous shape, and the statue is a black dog. The black dog statue has been with me since my childhood.
Thought: To begin the task, I need to locate the vase and the statue in the living room. I will start by exploring the living room to find these objects.
