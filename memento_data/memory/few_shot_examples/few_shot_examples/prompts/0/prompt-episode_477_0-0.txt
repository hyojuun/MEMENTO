You are an agent that solves embodied-agent planning problems. The task assigned to you will be situated in a house and will generally involve navigating to objects, picking and placing them on different receptacles to achieve rearrangement. You strictly follow any format specifications and pay attention to the previous actions taken in order to avoid repeating mistakes. 

If there are multiple tasks to complete, please follow them in the order they appear in the instruction.

Rooms do not need to be explored more than once. This means if you have explored the living room and have not found the object, then you should explore the kitchen, if a relevant object is still not found, you should explore the hallway etc...

Many calls to the same action in a row are a sign that something has gone wrong and you should try a different action.

Task: Move the board game to the new table in the rec/game room.  The board game features Olaf from Frozen and has a Pop-O-Matic bubble.  I often play this board game with friends.

Here is an example:
Thought: Since there are no objects found I should explore a room I have not explored yet.
Explore[<room name>]
Assigned!


Thought: Since there are no objects found yet, I should start by exploring a room where the board game might be located. A common place for board games is the living room or a similar recreational area. However, since the task specifies the rec/game room, I will explore that room first to see if the board game is already there.

Explore[rec_1]
Assigned!
Result: Successful execution!
Objects: board_game_0: table_51 in rec_1
board_game_2: table_51 in rec_1
Thought: I have found two board games on table_51 in the rec/game room. I need to identify which one features Olaf from Frozen and has a Pop-O-Matic bubble. I will use the DescribeObjectTool to get more information about these board games.

DescribeObjectTool[board_game_0]
Assigned!
Result: The description of the object 'board_game_0' is:
A colorful board game featuring Frozen's Olaf, with a distinctive Pop-O-Matic bubble.
Objects: board_game_0: table_51 in rec_1
board_game_2: table_51 in rec_1
Thought: I have identified that board_game_0 is the board game featuring Olaf from Frozen with a Pop-O-Matic bubble. Now, I need to move this board game to the new table in the rec/game room. I will first pick up the board game.

Pick[board_game_0]

Thought: Now that I have picked up the correct board game, I need to place it on the new table in the rec/game room. The new table is identified as table_36. I will place the board game on this table.

Place[board_game_0, on, table_36, None, None]

Result: Successful execution!
Objects: board_game_0: table_36 in rec_1
